This author, inspired by the \"Great Moon Hoax,\" tried to convince the public that Monck Mason had travelled across the Atlantic ocean in a hot air balloon in only three days, but the story was quickly found out to be fabricated. Other works of short fiction by this author include one in which the narrator is tortured by the title strange devices as a victim of the Spanish Inquisition; one in which the narrator's family crest involves a foot crushing a snake, explaining the mistreatment of his wine-loving adversary; and one in which a prince and his guests confront a personification of disease, ending in their demise.

A poet with this name advocated for Licinius to follow the \u201cgolden mean\u201d and penned the line \u201cdulce et decorum est pro patria mori\u201d. For 10 points, give this name of the author of The Castle of Otranto and the poet of Ars Poetica.",

Because Kutuzov placed his headquarters too far to the rear, many of his subordinates, including Colonel Karl Von Clausewitz, had to direct the troops in his place.

Initially unaware of a predecessor's contributions in that field, he wrote three papers on statistical mechanics, published between 1902 and 1904.Though his work was almost entirely theoretical, the practical value of his contributions became evident with the development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th century. In 1954, a year before one scientist's death, he was asked by an interviewer who were the greatest thinkers that he had known; his answer was this man. His second wife was his mother's sister's child. He also worked on the application of Maxwell's equations to problems in physical optics. His work related to temporal squishing and apples falling. He probably never reviewed a patent application from the man who invented modern vector calculus, although he called that man \"the greatest mind in American history\"",

The use of TFAA allows this reaction to occur at higher temperatures but results in side products when the desired groups are not sterically hindered. A failed nucleoside coupling procedure led to the discovery of this reaction\u2019s predecessor by Pfitzner and Moffatt, which activates the central species using DCC. In this reaction\u2019s mechanism, a sulfur ylide decomposes after forming a five-membered ring transition state resulting in the desired product and an extremely foul smelling byproduct. The species which carries out this reaction can be produced by reacting dimethyl sulfide and chlorine in a procedure named for Corey and Kim. This reaction can be performed on compounds that might be hydrolyzed by the acidic conditions of the Jones reagent.

  <BODY>

<P>    First, thanks again for writing a letter for me!  I try to keep an updated list of achievements I'm proud of (or information that provides context for the CV) that might be helpful in remembering details when writing a letter.  I've broken it down into sections and the bullets are ordered in reverse chronological order within each section.  I'm not going to duplicate my scholar page, CV, research statement, teaching statement, and service statement, so I'm aiming to keep this document relatively short (I will repeat the most noteworthy stuff).  New material for academic year 2015-2016 in italic.</P>

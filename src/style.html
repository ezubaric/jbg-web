<h2>Style Guide</h2>

<p>When writing a document, there are many stylistic choices that are
relatively arbitrary.  I collect the arbitrary choices that I've made
in the course of my writing here both for my own reference and for my
students.  Many of these
are <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>-specific.</p>

<p>You'll likely disagree with much of what I say here.  In fact, I disagree
with some of it; sometimes the choices here reflect compromises done to minimize
friction with co-authors or choices made to minimize paper length (e.g.,
removing ISBNs from references).  Please do not point out places in papers where
I've deviated from these.  Sometimes I have good reasons for deviating: my style
is evolving, my co-authors wouldn't accept my conventions, or the journal
stipulated something different.  I also realize that, as with every document on
writing, there will be typos and mistakes here.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out Neil
Spring's <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nspring/software/style-check-readme.html">useful
resources</a> (including a script you can use with flymake when
editing LaTeX documents).  I disagree with the following rules:
<ul>
  <li> I use the British convention for quote marks (which makes more
sense to computer scientists, as below).
  <li> "sufficient" is a fine word (esp. for "sufficient statistics")
  <li> "<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/">Teh</a>" is almost never a
  mispelling when I write it
</ul>
The rest is great, however, and you should use it (with the above edits).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/styleguide/introduction">The Economist
style guide</a> is a good resource for exposing bad habits, and their
conventions are reasonable.  However, they are a British publication, so ignore
British-specific rules (I do have some other points of disagreement, such as
infinitives).</p>

<h3>Tense</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Almost everything should be in the present tense
  <li> This includes related work (even super old stuff like Aristotle)
  <li> This includes generative processes
  <li> It's okay to use the future tense for future work
</ul>

<h3>Punctuation</h3>

<ul>

  <li> Put footnotes <b>immediately</b> after sentence / clause punctuation.

    <pre>
      I'm hardly ever sick at sea.\footnote{Well, hardly ever.}
    </pre>

  <li> Do not use a comma between two verb phrases (no subject) joined by a conjunction.

     <pre>
       I washed the car and mowed the lawn.
     </pre>

  <li> Do use a comma between two independent clauses (subject and verb) joined by a conjunction.

     <pre>
       I washed the car, and I mowed the lawn.
     </pre>

  <li> Use an Oxford comma to set off the penultimate element in a list.</li>

    <pre>
      I had eggs, toast, and orange juice
    </pre>

  <li> Use LaTeX hyphens (-), en dashes (--), and em dashes (---) correctly

    <pre>
      This is a low-budget trip, and pages 78--101 describe the
      journey.  If the train is on time---which it never is---we'll
      get there tomorrow.
    </pre>

  <li> Put punctuation outside quotes (British / Canadian style, not American).
  Also make sure that your quotes go in the right direction; don't draft in MS
  Word and copy paste into a TeX document.  If you do, your quotes will be
  wrong (TeX uses different symbols for left and right quotes).

    <pre>
      In civilized cultures, this is called a ``coaster''.
    </pre>

  <li> Similarly, I use <i>M-x q</i> to word wrap paragraphs in emacs.  Like two
  spaces after a sentence, it looks better in editing but has no impact on
  layout (more practically, it helps you estimate text length while editing).

</ul>

<h3>Math</h3>

   <ul>
     <li> When in text, spell out all natural numbers less than or
     equal to one hundred.  Also spell out "infinity" unless it's in
     an equation or an algorithm.  Anything else should be represented
     in decimal unless prefixed by the base (e.g., "0b00010").

     <li> Do not use
     more <a href="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~vsanni/ph3/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements.pdf">significant
     digits</a> than you need to (or should!).

     <li> Make sure that all equations and math are nouns and are embedded in a sentence.

     <pre>
        The voltage is $V=IR$, where $I$ is the current.
     </pre>

     <li> Do not use phrases like "The entropy is defined as follows" when
     introducing an equation.  "The entropy is" or "we define entropy as" work
     better.

     <li> Remind readers what variables are if you haven't used them in a while.

     <li> When creating a multiline equation, use the align
     environment, and keep the alignment to the <b>right</b> of the
     equals sign.

<pre>
  \begin{align}
    4 = & 2 + 2 \\
      = & 1 + 1 \\
        & + 1 + 1 \\
      = & 4
  \end{align}
</pre>

     <li> Create macros for the following and use them consistently (or ask me for
       a preamble that defines these things)
       <ul>
	 <li> Underbraces for explaining complicated mathematical concepts
<pre>
\newcommand{\explain}[2]{\underbrace{#2}_{\mbox{\footnotesize{#1}}}}
</pre>
         <li> Gamma function with balanced parentheses
<pre>
\newcommand{\G}[1]{\Gamma \left( \textstyle #1 \right)}
</pre>
         <li> Log gamma function with balanced parentheses
<pre>
\newcommand{\LG}[1]{\log \Gamma \left( \textstyle #1 \right)}
</pre>
         <li> Digamma function with balanced parentheses
<pre>
\newcommand{\digambig}[1]{\Psi \left( #1 \right) }
</pre>
         <li> Digamma function with balanced parentheses but with squished fractions
<pre>
\newcommand{\digam}[1]{\Psi \left( \textstyle #1 \right) }
</pre>
         <li> Expectations
<pre>
\newcommand{\e}[2]{\mathbb{E}_{#1}\left[ #2 \right] }
</pre>
         <li> Entropies
<pre>
\newcommand{\h}[2]{\mathbb{H}_{#1}\left[ #2 \right] }
</pre>
         <li> Indicator variables
<pre>
\newcommand{\ind}[1]{\mathbb{I}\left[ #1 \right] }
</pre>
         <li> Exponential
<pre>
\newcommand{\ex}[1]{\mbox{exp}\left\{ #1\right\} }
</pre>
         <li> Partial derivatives
<pre>
\newcommand{\D}[2]{\frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2}}
</pre>
         <li> ELBO (for variational inference)
<pre>
\newcommand{\elbo}{\mathcal{L}}
</pre>
       </ul>
    <li> Do not use italics for distributions; it helps to define a macro
      <pre>
	\theta \sim \mbox{Dir}(\alpha)
      </pre>
    <li> Don't use a pipe for given; make sure there's space around it
      <pre>
	p(a\, | \,b) = \frac{ \sim p(b\, | \,a) p(a)}{p(b)}
      </pre>
    <li> Don't use default parens for big math items; use automatically
    resized parens
      <pre>
	I = \left( \frac{V}{R} \right)
      </pre>
    <li> Don't start sentences with a math symbol.
   </ul>

<h3>References within a document</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Prefix the label of a reference with the type of reference it is (use
    the first three letters of the type of thing it is: fig, tab, sec, etc.).</li>

      <pre>
	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:intro}
      </pre>

    <li> Keep references short and do not include spaces in the label (use
    hyphens if you <b>must</b> have more than one word, but this should be a
    rarity)

      <pre>
	\label{sec:romulan-treaty}
      </pre>

    <li>When using an inline reference, make sure there's a tilde
    between the noun and the number.  This makes sure that this
    doesn't get split between lines (non-breaking space).</li>

      <pre>
	As we show in Section~\ref{sec:intro}, long cat is long.
      </pre>

  </ul>

<h3>Stupid rules you should follow</h3>

  <p>Even though they're not really true, people get twitchy when you abuse them.
  So learn them as rules for professional writing (even though they're
  hogwash).</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Use "fewer" when comparing discrete amounts, and use "less" when
    comparing continuous amounts.

      <pre>
	To weigh less, he should eat fewer donuts.
      </pre>

    <li> Use "that" for restrictive clauses (no commas).  Use "which" for non-restrictive
    clauses (use commas).
      <pre>
	The pizza, which everyone loves, is from Conte's.  The pizza that fell
	on the floor is no longer edible, however.
      </pre>
    <li> Use "who" only with the nominative case (and "whom" in other cases).
    <li> Only use "data" as a plural noun (with one <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data">exception</a>).
    <li> Likewise, only use "media" as a plural noun.
  </ul>

<h3>Anti-rules</h3>

  <ul>
    <li> There's no blanket prohibition against the passive, but don't use it to obscure agency.
    <li> It's fine to end your sentence with a preposition.
    <li> It's fine to boldly split an infinitive.
    <li> It's fine (and often better) to use "they" as a singular gender-neutral pronoun.
  </ul>

<h3>Citations</h3>

  <p>Below, I suggest removing valuable metadata.  This is for two
  reasons: space and uniformity.  Unfortunately, the bibliography
  often counts against page length, so we need to keep our
  bibligraphies as short as possible while keeping them useful.
  Because we often have to strip bibtex entries, it helps to
  have <b>everything</b> be compact to preserve uniformity and having
  to do last minute massaging.  Just make everything obey these rules
  when you put it into your bibtex for the first time.</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Use bibtex

    <li> Define journal and conference names in a different bib file from the
    one you store your references in.  This way you can swap out long form title
    (Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics) with the
    short form title (ACL) if you're tight for space.

    <li> Put citations inside the relevant sentence but outside quotes.

    <pre>
      The rug really ``tied the room together''~\cite{dude-98}.
    </pre>

    <li> Put proper nouns (e.g., "Dirichlet", "Bernoulli", and "Pitman-Yor"
    are all named after people), in your bibtex file in brackets to make sure
    they get capitalized correctly

      <pre>
	title = {Latent {D}irichlet Allocation},
      </pre>


    <li> Do not include page numbers for conferences (nobody reads the paper versions anyway).

    <li> Do not include volumes for NIPS.  People just use the year.

    <li> Do not include DOIs or ISBNs

    <li> For numeric citation styles (e.g. NIPS), don't use inline citations as nouns; use the name.
      <pre>
        Moseby~\cite{moseby-11} shows that he can pull off red boots.
      </pre>

    <li> For natbib-like citations (e.g. ACL), use citet to accomplish this.

      <pre>
        \citet{moseby-11} shows that that he can pull off red boots.
      </pre>

  </ul>

<h3>Typography</h3>

  <ul>
    <li> Use small caps for acronyms (it looks better; I create a macro called
    "abr" to make this easier), and don't put periods after the letters in
    acronyms (the reason why: LaTeX uses smart spacing after periods, but
    doesn't handle sentence-final acronyms; this will make your life easier).
      <pre>
	\textsc{tla}s are popular in the \textsc{us} government.
      </pre>
    <li> If you have an abbreviation mid-sentence, make sure LaTeX knows not to
    use sentence final spacing.
      <pre>
        Crosby et al.\ have a very, very, very fine house.
      </pre>

        <li> Because I learned to type on monotype fonts, I will put two spaces
  after a period that ends a sentence.  There's no good reason to do this, but
  LaTeX knows to do the right thing in typesetting.  I continue to do it,
  though, because I think it looks better when editing in emacs with fixed-width
  fonts.  (You don't have to do it, but if you see me doing it, that's why; you
  don't have to worry about it / correct it.)

    <li> If it's allowed (ICML 2013 didn't, for instance), use the "times" package for serif fonts.
    <li> Write ligatures, umlauts, and other diacritics correctly.

      <pre>
	If you want to know what a f\^ete galante looks like to a physicist, look up Schr\"odinger in the Encyclop\ae dia
      </pre>

    <li> If you have a long list of names (e.g., journal title page), use
    non-breaking spaces between name components.

    <pre>
       Herr~Doktor~Professor~Albert~Einstein, Joe~the~Plumber
    </pre>

    <li> When presenting foreign text, use the <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/LGR08.02.05.pdf">Leipzig glossing rules</a>:
      <center>
        <img src="../images/gloss.png">
      </center>



  </ul>

<h3>Word choice</h3>

  <ul>
    <li> Use "first" rather than "firstly" (same for second, third, etc.).
    <li> Use "unlike" rather than "different from".
    <li> Never use "utilize"; always use "use".  Corollary: prefer "usage" over
    "utilization", unless it's a technical term.
    <li> You can always delete "this means".
    <li> You can always replace "in order to" with "to".
    <li> Don't say "it is well know"; either cite or just state the fact.
    <li> Prefer "toward" over "towards".
    <li> You can almost always delete "notice that".  (My dumb fingers are
    often very guilty of writing this.)
    <li> Use "we" rather than "this paper" or "this work".
    <li> Use "shown" over "denoted" or "listed".
    <li> Use "in addition" rather than "besides".
    <li> Try not to use "hedging" language (often, probably, etc.).  Either
    something is true or it isn't.  If it really is a mixed bag, quantify the
    amount (e.g., three out of four dentists).
    <li> Avoid the phrase "it has been shown"; if you have nothing more specific
    to say about it (e.g., <b>who</b> showed it), then just remove it.  It's an
    agentless appeal to authority.
    <li> If British and American English use different words, you should
    typically prefer the American ("elevator", "stroller", "diaper", "truck").
    The exception is when this could lead to confusion when one language's term
    is ambiguous.  In those cases, use the version that removes ambiguity.  As a
    consequence, use the British terms "trousers" (not "pants"), "crisps" (not
    "chips"), and "cashpoint" (not "ATM"), but use the American terms
    ("pacifier", "gasoline", "fries", and "cookies").
  </ul>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>

  <ul>
    <li> Make sure your paragraphs
    have <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/engagement/index.php?category_id=2&sub_category_id=1&article_id=29">topic
    sentences</a>.  Until you have mastered writing paragraphs, you shouldn't break this practice.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Writing a paper Collaboratively</h3>

  <ul>
    <li> Often, when computer scientists work together on a paper, they will
    discuss something using the concept of a "write token".  This concept comes
    from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring">token-ring</a>
    computer network.  The problem is that the computers share the same wires to
    send messages over the network.  If two computers try to send something at
    the same time, it will cause a problem.  The same problem comes up when
    writing a document; if two people try to edit the document at the same time,
    it can cause problems.

    <li> Thus, before editing a file shared in some collaborative environment
    (Dropbox, SVN, etc.), send an e-mail (or some other pre-arranged
    notification) to your coauthors.  Something along the lines of "I'm claiming
    the write tokens for foo.tex".  Then, edit the file to your heart's content,
    save and commit your changes, and then send an e-mail saying "I release the
    write tokens for foo.tex".  Bottom lines: only modify files for which you
    have the write token, and release tokens for any file that you're not
    actively editing.

    <li> As a consequence, it helps to "input" many smaller files to create
    the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents">whole
    document</a>.  This enables co-authors to claim tokens to specific sections
    on a file-by-file basis.  (SVN, CVS, and git allow you to merge files after
    agreeing to the same delineation of write tokens, but this is dangerous; I
    discourage it.)

    <li> Make sure that your text editor notifies you when the underlying file
    changes.  If this doesn't happen, then you might unintentionally clobber
    (overwrite) another's edits.  This happens as follows:
      <ol>
        <li> you edit a file (with your write tokens)

        <li> you save the file, commit, and release the write tokens

        <li> you leave the file open in your editor

        <li> Collaborator Charlie modifies the files

        <li> you update the file on your disk (but leave the file open in your editor)

        <li> you then make some changes to the file (after getting the write tokens)

        <li> and then you save those files, but because your editor never reflected the underlying changes, everything that Charlie did is forgotten

        <li> you commit the changes, and your version control software thinks
        that you knew that you were overwriting all of Charlie's changes
        (because it gave you the new file), and everyone else will also miss out
        on Charlie's changes

      </ol>
     Emacs does notify you when this happens.
    <li> When the deadline gets really close, I like to print out a copy of the
    paper, mark the changes with a pen, and then quickly grab all the tokens for
    a paper to implement those changes.  (If rewrites or large text additions
    are required, I do those in a scratch file.)  I can then very quickly
    implement my changes while holding the tokens for a short period of time.

    <li> Don't store the output of LaTeX in version control software.

  </ul>

<h3>Error Analysis</h3>

<p>When writing a paper with an objective measure of success or
failure, it is important to include an error analysis.  This is
helpful for multiple reasons: it shows that you've actually looked at
your data, that you understand what your algorithm is doing, and you
know how your method is better (or at least different) from other
algorithms.</p>

<p>For example, let's say that you're doing a paper on word
segmentation and you're comparing to
the <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/Pubs/pedersen-last-word-2008.pdf">Zigglebottom
segmenter</a>.  One thing you can do is sort all of your sentences by
the following metric: #words you got right - #words Zigglebottom got
right.  You should look at both extremes.  Are there patterns in the
things you get right and they get wrong?  If so, that likely reveals
something about what your algorithm is doing.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you're writing a paper on a well-known task / method,
you risk a reviewer reading it and saying, okay, I might do slightly
better, but why?  Are there pitfalls I should be aware of? It also
makes sure you understand what you're claiming better, which allows
you to write a better paper overall.</p>

<h3>Writing an Author Response Document</h3>

<p>For some conferences, you will have the opportunity to respond the the
reviews you've recieved.  This often doesn't matter.  Many times the
reviewers all loved or hated your paper.  You don't have much of a
chance to change their minds.  When your paper gets marginally
positive reviews, a good response can really help.</p>

<p>First, be as brief and civil as possible.  If you don't have much
to say, don't try to fill the space.  Only use as much of the allotted
space as you actually need.  If there are no statements of facts you
can offer to help clarify a reviewer's opinion, then just let it go.
Make sure to thank the reviewers and to be gracious.  They may be
idiot numbskulls who trashed your paper, but they did so as a
volunteer.  If they didn't understand something, it's usually your
fault for not writing it well in the first place.</p>

<p>Second, make your response as self-contained as possible.  The PC
will read your response by itself.  They should be able to get the
gist of the reviewer's opinions through your response <b>and</b>
understand your reply without looking anywhere else.  Obviously you
cannot include all necessary details, but make sure your response
stands on its own as a single, coherent document.</p>

  <pre>
    Reviewer Three questions whether the Pope is Catholic.  We follow
    the convention of Caption Obvious (2003), which has been the
    foundation of many subsequent papers.
  </pre>

<p>Don't get this wrong by writing your response as an inline e-mail.
It's an inefficient use of space and you can better frame the issues
than the reviewers.  (It may be helpful to compose the reponse next to
the reviews, but don't assume that the reader will have access to that
information.)</p>

<h3>Checklist before submitting something</h3>

  <ul>
    <li> Look over your citations.  Do they look uniform?  Sometimes when you
    copy/paste a bibtex citation, junk comes with.
    <li> Read over your section titles.  Do they tell a story?  Don't just use
    "introduction", "background", "model", "inference", "conclusion", etc.
    While your sections may map to those, call them something more specific.
    <li> Do your figures stand on their own?  Make sure a bored reader /
    reviewer can get the gist of what's going on through the figures alone.
    <li> Is your abstract persuasive and interesting?
    <li> Do a spellcheck!
    <li> Make sure you've spelled your co-authors' names correctly (not always
    obvious; perhaps they use middle initials or a different name / spelling for
    publishing) and you have the correct affiliation (did they move since you
    first wrote the paper)?
  </ul>

<h3>Talks</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Use Beamer and OmniGraffle
  <li> Don't use a laser pointer (integrate any emphasis into your slides).  People have a tendency to over-use laser pointers, and they are not always usable (because of the screen, multiple screens, etc.).
  <li> Don't read from notes.
  <li> If you can ever use a picture instead of an equation, choose the picture (even if it takes more time).
</ul>

<h3>Posters</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Use Beamer
  <li> Use blocks with informative titles (just like section headings)
  <li> Do not put two images / tables in a block unless they are
  showing <b>very</b> related information (e.g., don't put results from two
  different datasets in the same block).
</ul>

<p>When writing a document, there are many stylistic choices that are
relatively arbitrary.  I collect the arbitrary choices that I've made
in the course of my writing here both for my own reference and for my
students.  Many of these
are <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>-specific.</p>

<p>You'll likely disagree with much of what I say here.  In fact, I disagree
with some of it; sometimes the choices here reflect compromises done to minimize
friction with co-authors or choices made to minimize paper length (e.g.,
removing ISBNs from references).  Please do not point out places in papers where
I've deviated from these.  Sometimes I have good reasons for deviating: my style
is evolving, my co-authors wouldn't accept my conventions, or the journal
stipulated something different.  I also realize that, as with every document on
writing, there will be typos and mistakes here.</p>

Spring's <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nspring/software/style-check-readme.html">useful
resources</a> (including a script you can use with flymake when
editing LaTeX documents).  I disagree with the following rules:</p>

sense to computer scientists</A>, as below).
  <li> "sufficient" is a fine word (esp. for "sufficient statistics")
  <li> "<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/">Teh</a>" is almost never a
  mispelling when I write it

<h3>Why LaTeX?</h3>

<p>Sometimes I get asked by a new collaborator why I use LaTeX.  The
bad reason is that it's a convention.  It's quite obvious when a paper
is not written in LaTeX, and in many scientific fields, it's a sign
that you're not really part of the community: papers not written in
LaTeX are greeted with more skepticism than papers that are (and often
with good reason, non-LaTeX papers usually are worse than LaTeX ones
in my reviewing experience; not a rule, but a useful heuristic).</p>

<p>But these are social reasons to use LaTeX and are not particularly
convincing for pragmatic reasons.  So here are some pragmatic reasons
to use LaTeX instead of Word.</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Equations and Math</b>: LaTeX was designed to give clear and
  effective renderings of math.  Word does a poor job of both making
  math look good and allowing you to edit the math later.  You can
  make equations look good, but it's hard to edit.  Word also makes it
  very difficult to have inline math, as it often screws up the
  spacing between the lines.
    <pre>
      The density $\rho$ gives us the resistance $R=\rho L$ of the
      material.
    </pre>
  <li> <b>Templates</b>: Most venues provide LaTeX templates as their
  standard templates.  These are much easier to use than Word
  templates, which require far more fiddling.
  <li> <b>You Do Less</b>: In Word, you are tempted to move images and
  figures around to determine the placement.  This is because word
  gives you that flexibility, and it's hard to ignore the siren call
  of tweaking.  In LaTeX, you provide suggestions on placement and it
  does the best it can based on pre-programmed rules (e.g., you tell
  it that it should be at the top or bottom of a page).
  <li> <b>References</b>: One of my biggest annoyances when I am
  forced to work in Word is how hard it is to easily refer to
  different chapters, citations, or figures in a way that will be
  automatically generated.  I know there are ways to do it, but it
  often has huge issues and requires obnoxious plugins.  In most cases
  it is either done manually or requires substantial post-correction.
  LaTeX does all of these automatically, and it just works.
  <li> <b>Macros</b>: More generally, skilled LaTeX writers develop a
  set of macros that vastly improves productivity and consistency.
  These range from typsetting conventions references (e.g., to the
  name of your approach, institutions, etc.).  Because LaTeX makes it
  easy to import files, you can share references across many documents
  that you're working on at the same time.
  <li> <b>Collaboration</b>: Because LaTeX is just text files and it
  is easy to include on file in another, you can use tools like git to
  work with others as you create your paper.
  <li> <b>Cost</b>: Unlike Word, it's free and open source.  LaTeX
  hasn't changed much in 20 years, so you can still read and compile
  papers without anything being messed up.  Word changes every five
  minutes.
  <li> <b>Accessibility</b>: When I communicate with blind
  researchers, they always ask if I have a LaTeX version.  They can
  write and read LaTeX much more easily than Word or PDF (especially
  when there's math; screen readers always screw up embedded equations
  in Word).
</ul>

least <a href="http://jeffhuang.com/better_word_papers.html">make your Word
documents look nice</a> (but it's a lot of work).</p>

<h3>Why not settle for "Good Enough"?</h3>

Writing scientifically is an art and <a
href="https://twitter.com/iraphas13/status/1262489387767480322">has
always been</a>.  While computers make life easier,
it doesn't absolve you of the responsibility to clearly and cleanly
expressing what you want to say.  


<h3>Writing Clearly and Directly</h3>	
	
<P>While writing, it's important to write clearly.  There are whole
books about this (mentioned above), but it might be useful to go
through an example of what this looks like.
<PRE>
Follow-up work can be directed specifically at the game of Diplomacy or can be
applied broadly to human-in-the-loop research. This task can be scoped at a
general or a player-specific basis. In the general case, the data is trained on
all players but a certain one. Then the actions for only that player are
predicted. This can be made country-specific---train on data from the majority
of users playing as Turkey and test on several held out players. This would
ascertain whether linguistic cues or specific game actions are more likely to
reveal an impending betrayal. Alternatively, we can use our lie-detection
models for a human-in-the-loop approach to identifying deception. The model can
be used creating a player interface that provides model insights to players in
real-time to make better game decisions. Or the data can be used to create
dialog for a Diplomacy bot, although ensuring that the language corresponds to
an appropriate scenario is integral.
</PRE>
	
<ul>
	<li> <b>scoped at a general or player-specific basis</b>: both
	"basis" and "scoped" are vague and jargony.  It would be more
	direct to say: "When we look for lies, we can either look for
	what a lie looks like in general or what a specific person's
	lies look like."
	<li> <b>Alternatively, we can use our lie-detection models for
	a human-in-the-loop approach to identifying deception</b>:
	"Approach" is another vague word, and introducing a new idea
	should connect to the first point.  Better to say: "Instead of
	general lie detection, you would rather know if <i>you</i> are
	being lied to in the moment.
	<li> <b>The model can be used creating a player interface that
	provides model insights to players in real-time to make better
	game decisions.</b>: While there's no blanket prohibition
	against the passive, it can sometimes obscure agency.  "The
	model can be used" doesn't explain how the model can help
	someone.  Better to say: "Our models can identify words that
	find words, phrases, and situations that portend deception and
	warn potential victims of deception before it's too late."
	<li> <b>Or the data can be used to create dialog for a
	Diplomacy bot</b>: Needs a transition from other concepts in
	paragraph but might be better in its own paragraph. Let's
	focus on transitions a little more.
</ul>

<h3>Transitions</h3>

<PRE> Famously, \abr{ibm} Watson was victorious in a match against the
best trivia players in the world, and in this thesis I describe an
exhibition event where my system also defeated decorated trivia
players.  Despite my system defeating good trivia players, it was
hollow since I knew that our system was nothing more than well-done
pattern matchingâ€”i.e., nothing like human reasoning.
</PRE>

Let's put aside "victorious" (prefer verbs to adjectives generally).
  There are three ideas here, but the "and" doesn't add much.  The
  real contrast is between the second two ideas.  The final idea
  obscures what the contrast is between with the vacuous "it", so it's
  good to repeat "victory" here.

<pre>

While the system described in this thesis likewise defeated decorated
trivia players, this victory was hollow since our system was nothing

</ul>

<h3>Tense</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Almost everything should be in the present tense
  <li> This includes related work (even super old stuff like Aristotle)
  <li> This includes generative processes
  <li> It's okay to use the future tense for future work

  papers</a>
  <ol>
<li> findings from past studies are in past tense or, if they still apply today, are in present perfect
<li> method detail from past studies is in past tense
<li> our own approach, method, and specific findings are in past tense
<li> general conclusions of the paper / findings are in present tense because they are still true (rather than completed and in the past) at the time the paper is written (and hopefully read!)
  </ol>
  <li> There's also a rare exception to be made when you need to
  distinguish how something was done in the past to how it is used
    today.
    <pre>
      Retrofitting was originally introduced for refining monolingual word
embeddings with a lexical ontology~\citep{faruqui-15}, for \abr{clwe},

<!---

  Em dash: â€”
This is the longest dash. It was named for being the exact width of a capital M in the same font; that's no longer always true, but the em is still a unit used in typography (you may have used it, or its friend the root em [rem], in CSS).
You make it by typing option+shift+hyphen on Mac. Windows doesn't have any easy keyboard shortcut, but you can do alt+0151 (has to be on the number pad) if you're adventurous. Depending on your settings, a double hyphen may autocorrect to it. It's never typographically correct to use a double hyphen as an em dash substitute.
An em dash separates thoughts in an abrupt mannerâ€”like this. That also includes pure cutoff, when someone doesn't finish theirâ€”
The em dash is an alternative to commas and parentheses in setting off an appositiveâ€”which is an explanatory aside in the middle of a sentenceâ€”and is occasionally used in salutations in letters:
Cat â€”
We are pleased to inform you that you've won the lottery.
"The em dash is used to attribute quotations." â€”Jonah Greenthal
In old-timey books and other publications, em dashesâ€”sometimes several in a rowâ€”are used to censor or redact proper names for a variety of reasons. Here's the first sentence of the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation of Crime and Punishment:
At the beginning of July, during an extremely hot spell, towards evening, a young man left the closet he rented from tenants in Sâ€”â€”y Lane, walked out to the street, and slowly, as if indecisively, headed for the Kâ€”â€”n Bridge.
I think the idea is that someone familiar with the St. Petersburg of the time (including contemporaneous readers) would know what was meant, but omitting the actual name was a sign of respect and avoided certain legal issues. I think this is also what's theoretically going on when you see people write "Thank G-d", but using an em dash there would look stupid because it's only replacing one letter. Also those people probably aren't thinking hard about typography.
En dash: â€“
This is of middle length and is named for being the exact width of a capital N in the same font. I think that still usually applies, even though the em etymology doesn't. The en is a typographical unit too, but it's not used as much as the em.
You make it by typing option+hyphen on Mac. Windows doesn't have any easy keyboard shortcut, but you can do alt+0150 (has to be on the number pad) if you're adventurous. I don't think any autocorrection is conventionally available.
An en dash separates ranges. This includes numeric ranges (I use en dashes 5â€“10 times a day), ranges that involve numbers but are not strictly numeric ("I charge $20â€“$40 per en dash in the 12:00â€“2:00 hours"), ranges that only partly involve numbers ("I haven't died yet" â€”Jonah Greenthal, 1989â€“present), and ranges that don't involve numbers ("Make sure you use correct dashes Mondayâ€“Friday").
The en dash is often used for separating numbers in other contexts ("The Cubs won 8â€“7") or other related things of the same type ("I'm driving Chicagoâ€“Milwaukee", "the Einsteinâ€“Podolskyâ€“Rosen paradox is my favorite triply eponymous thought experiment").
Conceptually, a minus sign and a negative sign are separate from the en dash and from each other, but you use the same symbol for all of them (i.e., an en dash). When I say they're conceptually different, I mean they carry different semantic value, just as # can mean a number of pounds, a key on a phone, or a hashtag. Also, e.g., 5â€“10 could mean either "five to ten" or "five minus ten" despite using the same symbol, but you gotta know the territory.
Hyphen: -
This is the shortest common dash. It is named for the Greek Î·Ï…Ï†ÎµÎ½*, meaning "hyphen". You type it by pressing the hyphen key.
*I made that up
The hyphen is the hardest of these to use correctly. One rule would be "If you want to use a dash of some kind and it's not one of the situations I covered above, use a hyphen." But that doesn't tell when to use a hyphen vs. a space vs. nothing. Unfortunately, I don't actually know all the rules. I have somehow developed a really good intuitive sense of when to use punctuation (weird flex), which makes it hard to teach. So here are some of the common rules I found when researching:
The hyphen is used in compound modifiers (two words that effectively form one adjective). For example, it would be correct to write "No-headache home repair." But you don't use a hyphen after an adverb ending in "-ly" or "very" so you'd say "those are very beautifully placed spaces between those words." I think one general rule is that if the compound wouldn't make sense with a word removed, you need a hyphen. ("No home repair" and "headache home repair" don't make sense, but they still convey enough of an idea to be poor slogans.)
Speaking of which, you often use hyphens for prefixes and suffixes. Except sometimes you use nothing ("correct hyphen use is a precondition of your employment"); I don't think there's a hard-and-fast rule for that. (Hey, that's a compound modifier.) The same is true of compound words: they can have a space, hyphen, or nothing depending on common style, and you just have to know or check. Moreover, usage tends to change toward "no space or hyphen": "e-mail" used to be common but now people mostly write "email"; "policeman" was once hyphenated too.
Guess what character is used to hyphen-
ate words when a line wraps?
You use a hyphen for numbers between twenty-one and ninety-nine when writing them out (which you probably shouldn't do anyway, but).
In general, use a hyphen to show that two words are more closely
connected than other pairs of adjacent words. "Jayme threw Jonah out
of the second floor window" is weird because what is a "floor window"?
Oh, you meant "Jayme threw Jonah out of the second-floor window."
(This is also a compound modifier example.)

      <li> Use the <A HREF="https://ctan.org/pkg/fnpct?lang=en">fnpct package</a> to make the interaction between
      footnotes and punctuation less akward.
      <li> There's some belief that you can put a footnote before punctuation if you're following German rules.  This actually is not the case (it's more complicated, and usually our footnotes are whole sentences&mdash;we use bibliographic citations within sentences):
        <blockquote>
Fu&szlig;noten k&ouml;nnen ohne Schlusspunkt stehen, wenn sie nur einzelne W&ouml;rter umfassen. Man fasst sie aber besser als AuslassungssÃ¤tze auf und setzt einen Punkt (besonders wenn im selben Text Fu&szlig;noten mit ganzen S&auml;tzen und Schlusspunkt vorkommen). (Duden 2016)
        </blockquote>
       <li> This goes for affiliations as well; put footnote after the
       comma (this is a case where the German rules would say put
       footnote before comma, but <b>don't do that</b>).
	<li> Exception: footnotes can come before a dash.
	<blockquote>
A note number should generally be placed at the end of a sentence or at the end of a clause. The number normally follows a quotation (whether it is run into the text or set as an extract). Relative to other punctuation, the number follows any punctuation mark except for the dash, which it precedes.
	</blockquote>
    </ul>
    
  <li> Don't put footnotes on a number (it looks like an exponent).

  <li> Do not use a comma between two verb phrases (no subject) joined by a conjunction.

     <pre>
       I washed the car and mowed the lawn.
     </pre>

  <li> Do use a comma between two independent clauses (subject and
  verb) joined by a conjunction.

     <pre>
       I washed the car, and I mowed the lawn.
     </pre>

  <li> Use an Oxford comma to set off the penultimate element in a list.</li>

    <pre>
      I had eggs, toast, and orange juice
    </pre>

  <li>  To sum up, whenever you have a comma before an
  "and" or "but" joining two things, see whether you have both a subject and
  a verb in what follows.  If you don't, you shouldn't have a comma
  there.

  <li> Use LaTeX hyphens (-), en dashes (--), and em dashes (---) correctly

  <li> Put punctuation outside quotes (British / Canadian style, not American).  This is hard for some people to do, particularly for over-ambituous American students who want to be "right".  But doing things the British way is not just clearer but defensible from a linguistic stanpoint, <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/punctfree.pdf">as beautifully argued by Pullum</a>.
  Also make sure that your quotes go in the right direction; don't draft in MS
  Word and copy paste into a TeX document.  If you do, your quotes will be
  wrong (TeX uses different symbols for left and right quotes).

    <pre>
      In civilized cultures, this is called a ``coaster''.

  <li> Similarly, I use <i>M-x q</i> to word wrap paragraphs in emacs.  Like two
  spaces after a sentence, it looks better in editing but has no impact on
  layout (more practically, it helps you estimate text length while editing).

</ol>

<h3>Figures</h3>

   <ol>
      <li> If a figure has a caption, use the top or bottom
      positioning.  Center the actual image, and be sure to provide a
      label.

        <pre>
	\begin{figure}[tb]
	  \begin{center}
	  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{2015_hoverboard/awesome}
	  \end{center}
	  \caption{Jetpacks are next.}
	  \label{fig:hoverboards}
	\end{figure}
	</pre>

      <li> If the figure has no caption, you can use "here".
      <li> Make sure the caption stands on its own.  When a reviewer
      first sees a paper, they will often just skim the figures.  Make
      sure that if a reader does this they will get a sense of what
      the paper is about and the clear takeaway from each figure.
      <li> Try to use full sentences in the caption.
      <li> <A NAME="Vector">Use raster / vector formats as appropriate.</A>  In general, photos
      should be wavlet formats (jpg), hand-drawn cartoons, logos, or images with
      alpha channels should be low-pallete rasters (png), and everything else
      should be a vector format (pdf/eps).  This is another way that LaTeX is
      far superior to Word, where it's much harder to insert graphics without
      vector formats being lost.  (Omnigraffle and ggplot2 by default create
      vector pdfs; another reason to use them!)

     If you need a screenshot of a webpage, you can <A HREF="https://github.com/felixfbecker/dom-to-svg">convert a given

      <li> Don't supply file extensions; pdflatex/latex will choose
      for you (makes it easy to switch between the two).

     <li> Don't use <a
     href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/88929/vertical-table-lines-are-discontinuous-with-booktabs/88939#88939">vertical
     rules in your tables</a>.  It's fine to use shading (light gray)
     when you have text (like lists of topic words) that makes it hard to see when
     one row starts and another ends.

<h3>Stupid rules you should follow</h3>

  <p>Even though they're not really true, people get twitchy when you abuse them.
  So learn them as rules for professional writing (even though they're
  hogwash).</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Use "fewer" when comparing discrete amounts, and use "less" when
    comparing continuous amounts.

      <pre>
	To weigh less, he should eat fewer donuts.
      </pre>

    <li> Use "that" for restrictive clauses (no commas).  Use "which" for non-restrictive
    clauses (use commas).
      <pre>
	The pizza, which everyone loves, is from Conte's.  The pizza that fell
	on the floor is no longer edible, however.
      </pre>

    <li> Use "who" only with the <a
     href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/who_vs_whom">nominative case</a> (and
    "whom" in other cases).

      <ol>
	<li> who can use this (subject of "can use")
	<li> for whom we designed this (object of preposition)
	<li> who gave a lecture (subject of verb "gave")
	<li> Caltech tenured whom? (object of verb "tenured")

       </ol>
    <li> Only use "data" as a plural noun (with one <a
    href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data">exception</a>).
    <li> Likewise, only use "media" as a plural noun.
    <li> Trickier is "criteria" (plural) and "criterion" (singular):
    "Some good criteria are ..." vs. "A good criterion is ... ".
    Avoid sounding pompus but still be technically correct (the best
    kind of correct) by using "criteria" as a plural noun.
  </ol>

<h3>Anti-rules</h3>

  <p>Some people don't think you should do the following, but I disagree.  Feel
  free to completely ignore these non-rules.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> There's no blanket <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html">prohibition against the passive</a>, but don't use it to obscure agency.
    <li> It's fine to end your sentence with a preposition if it sounds natural.
    <li> It's fine to boldly split an infinitive.
    <li> It's fine (and often better) to use "they" as a singular gender-neutral pronoun.
  </ol>

<h3>Referencing Related Work</h3>

  <ol>
    <li> When you cite something, make sure the reader has enough context to know why you cited it.
      <pre>
	We analyze the messages through persuasion tactics, which have been used in cybersecurity~\cite{oliveira-17}.
      </pre>
      This is accurate enough, but "cybersecurity" is so broad.  Is this even looking at text?  Make it clear that you read the paper:
      <pre>
	We analyze messages using persuasion tactics~\cite{cialdini-04}, which \newcite{oliveira2017dissecting} apply to detect spear phishing e-mails and \newcite{anand-11} apply to persuasive blogs.
      </pre>

  </ol>

<h3><A NAME="Citations">Citations</A></h3>

  <p>Below, I suggest removing valuable metadata.  This is for two
  reasons: space and uniformity.  Unfortunately, the bibliography
  often counts against page length, so we need to keep our
  bibligraphies as short as possible while keeping them useful.
  Because we often have to strip bibtex entries, it helps to
  have <b>everything</b> be compact to preserve uniformity and having
  to do last minute massaging.  Just make everything obey these rules
  when you put it into your bibtex for the first time.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Use bibtex and use it correctly
      <ol>
        <li> Do not abbreviate names (i.e., use "Thomas Stearns
    Elliot", not "T. S. Elliot") in your files.  Bibtex will will do
    this for you, and you will be out of luck if your citation file
    uses full names (like ACL).
        <li> Make sure that you are using the correct citation type for
          articles, books, chapters, etc.
          <ol>
            <li> For example, if you are citing an entry from <i>The
            Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence</i>, you don't
            cite the whole book.  You'd cite an individual chapter
            (e.g., the chapter on "Question Answering" by Bonnie
            Webber, pages 814-822).  The editor (Stuart Shapiro) is
              not the author and shouldn't appear in the text.
            <li> Theses have their own bibtex type.
          </ol>
        <li> Put proper nouns (e.g., "Dirichlet", "Bernoulli", and
    "Pitman-Yor" are all named after people) and model/dataset names
    (e.g., QuAC, BERT) in your bibtex file in brackets to make sure
    they get capitalized correctly.
      <pre>
	title = {Latent {D}irichlet Allocation},
        title = {A qualitative comparison of {CoQA}, {SQuAD 2.0}, and {QuAC}},
      </pre>
        <li> Do not put the entire title in brackets (will bite you later).
        <li> Make sure all raw titles have consistent capitalization (something that looks good).
      </ol>

    <li> Define journal and conference names in a different bib file from the
    one you store your references in.  This way you can swap out long form title
    (Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics) with the
    short form title (ACL) if you're tight for space.  Plus, it makes sure your
    citations are consistent.

      The rug really ``tied the room together''~\cite{dude-98}.

    <li> Do not include volumes for NeurIPS.  People just use the year.

    <li> Do not include DOIs or ISBNs

    <li> For numeric citation styles (e.g., NeurIPS), don't use inline citations as nouns; use the name.
      <pre>
        Moseby~\cite{moseby-11} shows that he can pull off red boots.

    <li> For natbib-like citations (e.g. ACL), use citet/newcite to cite as a noun.  <b>Don't</b> use a non-breaking space in this case.

      <pre>
        \citet{moseby-11} shows that that he can pull off red boots.
      </pre>

    <li> Don't include material that's only title, author, and year.
    That's not enough information to find it.  Make sure you include
    either a web address (ArXiV), a university (theses), or a venue (most things).

    <li> When introducing a paper with, for example, an acronym you'll use
    throughout the paper, put the acronym in the citation brackets.

    <pre>
       We compare word-level represenations~\cite[Word2Vec]{mikolov-13}
       against document-level representations~\cite[\abr{lda}]{blei-03}.
    </pre>

    <li> Many ArXiv citations actually shouldn't be.  If it has appear
    in a real venue (or will), give that citation.  Often this changes
    between when you submit a paper and when it's accepted.  Double
      check all of your ArXiv citations.

    <li> Don't cite both CoRR and ArXiv.  Pick one and stick with it (ArXiv would be my suggestion).

    <li> Don't do a citation dump with more than two cites together.
    They can't all be identical.  Either cut or break apart so people
    know why you're citing each paper.

    <li> Be specific when you use a citation so that the reader knows
    why you're using a citation (it also proves you've read and
      understood the paper).  So don't do:

Thus, here we analyze the game through persuasion
tactics~\cite{cialdini2004social} (\textit{italicized} this section),

      This doesn't give enough information about what the paper did.
      Something with cybersecurity and Cialdini.  It's not even clear
      that this is about text (important in an NLP paper).  Instead,
      write with specifics:

<h3>Typography</h3>

    <li> For topic modeling papers, put mentions of words in quotes
    and topics (e.g., from a topic model) in underline (topic macro).

      <pre>
        We wanted to understand why the \underline{research} topic has
      high probability for ``procrastination'', but we leave that for
      future work.
      </pre>

    <li> For question answering papers, put question words in quotes
    and answers in underline.

      <pre>
	If you see ``phosphonium ylide'', the system always responds
	\underline{Wittig Reaction}.
      </pre>

    <li> If you are writing a question answering paper that uses topic
    models, this bullet point will have to be updated.

    <li> Use small caps for acronyms (it looks better; I create a macro called
    "abr" to make this easier), and don't put periods after the letters in
    acronyms (the reason why: LaTeX uses smart spacing after periods, but
    doesn't handle sentence-final acronyms; this will make your life easier).

    use sentence final spacing.
      <pre>
        Crosby \textit{et al}.\ have a very, very, very fine house.
      </pre>

        <li> Because I learned to type on monotype fonts, I will put two spaces
  after a period that ends a sentence.  There's no good reason to do this, but
  LaTeX knows to do the right thing in typesetting.  I continue to do it,
  though, because I think it looks better when editing in emacs with fixed-width
  fonts.  (You don't have to do it, but if you see me doing it, that's why; you
  don't have to worry about it / correct it.)

    <li> Put features (for supervised learning) in monospaced fonts
    (feat macro).

    <pre>
      The number of words in a document (e.g., \texttt{doclen:13})
      is the final feature.
    </pre>

    <li> If it's allowed (ICML 2013 didn't, for instance), use the
    "times" package for serif fonts.

    <li> For ordinals, write them out if they're less than or equal to one
    hundred.  For ordinals greater than one hundred, use a text superscript.

    <pre>
      The Second Reich loved its 247\textsuperscript{th} pointy helmet design.

	If you want to know what a f\^ete galante looks like to a
	physicist, look up Schr\"odinger in the Encyclop\ae dia
      </pre>

    <li> Put a non-breaking space between references, citations, and math symbols.  <b>Do not put a space before the non-breaking space;</b> this defeats the purpose.  Your word should end, be followed by a non-breaking space, followed by the reference, citation, or symbol.  This prevents a line breaking between references and the thing they're connected to.</li>

<h3>Word choice</h3>

  <p>I have put the most annoying and frequent issues at the top of the
  list and made the font size large.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> <font size="+1">You can always delete "it turns out that",
    "we find that", "we show", "we provide", "our findings/results
    suggest that" (and variants).</font>  If you want to actually
    hedge, then explain why there's some doubt (i.e., don't use
    "suggest" as a flimsy shield).
    <li> Never use the word "performance".  It's likely a stand-in for
    something else (e.g., "accuracy", "latency", or "F1").  Say what
    you actually mean.</li>
    <li> Avoid "perform an X".  X is likely a noun form of a
    verb.  Just use that verb.  Don't "perform a split" or "perform a
    cross-validation" or "perform a song".  Just "split",
    "cross-validate", or "sing".
    <li> Use "first" rather than "firstly" (same for second, third, etc.).
    <li> Use "unlike" rather than "different from".
    <li> Never use "utilize"; always use "use".  Corollary: prefer
    "usage" over "utilization", unless it's a technical term.  Same
    thing with "leverage" (unless there's mechanical advantage
    involved).
    <li> You can always delete "this means".
    <li> You can always replace "in order to" with "to".
    <li> You can replace "X nature" with the adjective form of X:
    "helpful nature" can be "helpfulness" or "usefulness".
    <li> Never say "In this section, we"; just say "This section" or "We".
    <li> You can always replace "to do this we" with "we".
    <li> Use "while" rather than "whereas".
    <li> Don't say "it is well known"; either cite or just state the
    fact.
    <li> Don't say "the fact that".
    <li> Prefer "toward" over "towards".
    <li> You can almost always delete "notice that" or "note that".  (My dumb fingers are
    often very guilty of writing this.)
    <li> Use "we" rather than "this paper" or "this work".
    <li> Use "shown" over "denoted" or "listed".
    <li> Use "in addition" rather than "besides".
    <li> Use "certainty" rather than "certitude".</li>
    <li> Unless you're talking about physically knocking someone to the ground,
    don't use the verb "tackle".</li>
    <li> Try not to use "hedging" language (often, probably, etc.).  Either
    something is true or it isn't.  If it really is a mixed bag, quantify the
    amount (e.g., three out of four dentists).
    <li> Avoid the phrase "it has been shown"; if you have nothing more specific
    to say about it (e.g., <b>who</b> showed it), then just remove it.  It's an
    agentless appeal to authority.

    <li> If British and American English use different words, you
    should typically prefer the American ("elevator", "stroller",
    "diaper", "truck").  The exception is when this could lead to
    confusion when one language's term is ambiguous.  In those cases,
    use the version that removes ambiguity.  As a consequence, use the
    British terms "trousers" (not "pants"), "crisps" (not "chips"),
    and "cashpoint" (not "ATM"), but use the American terms "pacifier"
    (not "dummy"), "gasoline" (not "petrol"), "fries" (not "chips"),
    and "cookie" (not "biscuit").  Most of these examples will not be
    relevant in academic writing, but "factoid" is one notable
    example.  British speakers view it as something that
    is <b>untrue</b>.  Try to avoid it if possible.  (I learned about this <a
     href="../docs/2014_emnlp_qb_rnn.pdf">too late</a> from <a
     href="http://www.karlmoritz.com/">KMH</a>.)

    <li> I will default to American spelling.  If you send me a
    nearly-complete draft using consistent <b>British</b> spelling, I will
    gladly keep that convention (being an Economist reader finally
    pays off).  If you use Indian or Canadian spelling, experience has
    shown that I will turn it into American spelling as I edit (sorry,
    I just can't keep the intermediate cases straight).

    <li> In academic writing, avoid contractions.

    <li> Generally, use the simpler, more direct word.  Sometimes when
  writing an academic paper there's a pull to sound "fancy".  But it
    often makes the writing unclear.
    <pre>
 the video content has to be integrated with the headline subtlety
  while assessing headline veracity
</pre>
sounds complicated, but it's actually something fairly simple
<pre>
you have to watch the video to know if the headline is representative
  or has a sublte exaggeration or misrepresentation
</pre>
  </ol>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>

  <ol>
    <li> Make sure your paragraphs have <a
    href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/engagement/index.php?category_id=2&sub_category_id=1&article_id=29">topic
    sentences</a>.  Until you have mastered writing paragraphs, you
    shouldn't break this practice.</li>
    <li> Use <a
    href="http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/summary-and-transition/">transitions</a>
    liberally.  I've yet to see a student use too many transitions.  I
    long for the day when I delete an extra transition.
  </ol>

<h3><A NAME="Tracker">Writing a paper Collaboratively</A></h3>

  <ol>
    <li> Often, when computer scientists work together on a paper, they will
    discuss something using the concept of a "write token".  This concept comes
    from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring">token-ring</a>
    computer network.  The problem is that the computers share the same wires to
    send messages over the network.  If two computers try to send something at
    the same time, it will cause a problem.  The same problem comes up when
    writing a document; if two people try to edit the document at the same time,
    it can cause problems.

    <li> Thus, before editing a file shared in some collaborative environment
    (Dropbox, SVN, etc.), send an e-mail (or some other pre-arranged
    notification) to your coauthors.  Something along the lines of "I'm claiming
    the write tokens for foo.tex".  Then, edit the file to your heart's content,
    save and commit your changes, and then send an e-mail saying "I release the
    write tokens for foo.tex".  Bottom lines: only modify files for which you
    have the write token, and release tokens for any file that you're not
    actively editing.

    <li> As a consequence, it helps to "input" many smaller files to create
    the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents">whole
    document</a>.  This enables co-authors to claim tokens to specific sections
    on a file-by-file basis.  (SVN, CVS, and git allow you to merge files after
    agreeing to the same delineation of write tokens, but this is dangerous; I
    discourage it.)

    <li> Make sure that your text editor notifies you when the underlying file
    changes.  If this doesn't happen, then you might unintentionally clobber
    (overwrite) another's edits.  This happens as follows:
      <ol>
        <li> you edit a file (with your write tokens)

        <li> you save the file, commit, and release the write tokens

        <li> you leave the file open in your editor

        <li> Collaborator Charlie modifies the files

        <li> you update the file on your disk (but leave the file open in your editor)

        <li> you then make some changes to the file (after getting the write tokens)

        <li> and then you save those files, but because your editor never reflected the underlying changes, everything that Charlie did is forgotten

        <li> you commit the changes, and your version control software thinks
        that you knew that you were overwriting all of Charlie's changes
        (because it gave you the new file), and everyone else will also miss out
        on Charlie's changes

      </ol>

     <p><b>Emacs does notify you when this happens</b>: either use
     emacs or a text editor that does this.</p>

    <li> When the deadline gets really close, I like to print out a
    copy of the paper, mark the changes with a pen, and then quickly
    grab all the tokens for a paper to implement those changes.  (If
    rewrites or large text additions are required, I do those in a
    scratch file.)  I can then very quickly implement my changes while
    holding the tokens for a short period of time.  If time is really
    short and there are lots of papers going in for a deadline, I may
    hand you (physically or virtually) the marked up version to
    implement the changes.  This is meant to save time.  If anything
    is unclear, please <b>ask me</b>.

    <li> If you're actively editing a file, you should only
put in the files needed to <b>generate</b> the output.  Do not store
the intermediate or final output (pdf, log, aux, etc.).  This is not
just to save space (every little change, no matter how small, will
force a multi-megabyte file to be saved) but also because it can get
in the way of other people as they're compiling the document.</li>

    <li>I also prefer using pdf (vector) and png (raster) files for graphics
(as appropriate); this is because the output of pdflatex is usually
better/easier than that of latex.  </li>

    <li> Organize the files as follows:
      <ol>
	<li> Keep all style files (e.g. things that could be shared between submissions) in the "style" folder
	<li> Keep all bibliography files (e.g., bibtex source) in the "bib" folder
	<li> Have the main body in a file called
	"YYYY_venue_project.tex" and the associated data (sections,
	graphics, etc.) in a folder called "YYYY_venue_project"
	<li> This allows the Makefile to work well and reduces clutter
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li> <b>What about ShareLaTeX/Overleaf</b>?  I do not like to
    use these tools.  While they are good for people who are new to
    LaTeX or don't have a UNIX environment, I don't think they're a
    good tool for me.

      <ol>
	<li> They are not mature; I was able to crash ShareLaTeX
	through creating a series of folders.

	<li> They let you gloss over annoying errors (LaTeX itself
	should be more intuitive, but ShareLaTeX hides the complexity
	and thus problems)

	<li> I have scripts to find grammar / stylistic errors that
	are hard to integrate

	<li> I prefer to search multiple files using grep

	<li> I prefer to have my research code generate figures/data
	which can be added to paper repository with a single command
	line (makes replication easier)

	<li> I prefer to use emacs as editor; ShareLaTeX has pretty
	high latency while typing and lacks keyboard commands for
	easier editing (it also gets quotes wrong by default)

      </ol>

      I'm not going to say that you can never use Overleaf, but if you do and expect me to have non-trivial interaction with the paper, I will ask you to:
  <ol>
    <li> Organize files in <a
  href="https://github.com/Pinafore/publications/">the same way that I
  do</a>.  I should be able to download the source zip file and
  decompress it and run the Makefile to compile everything.</li>

    <li> Run my style scripts and address any errors before asking me
    to look at it (doing this is a good way of making sure it fits in
    my paper repository).

    <li> Incorporate my preamble for LaTeX-based commenting (don't use
    ShareLaTeX commenting, as that doesn't work with offline editing).

    <li> <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fill-Commands.html">Reflow
    all of your text</a>

    <li> Still obey the paper token tracking spreadsheet for exclusive
    editing (in case someone needs to edit offline on a plane or
    something).

  </ol>
</li>

  </ol>

  <h3>Timeline for Writing a Conference Paper</h3>

  There are at most five important dates in a paper's life cycle: the
  anonymityt deadline (at least for ACL papers), the submission
  deadline, the author response deadline, the camera ready deadline, and the presentation.  I'm
  going to go over each of these deadlines.  As a first author, it is
  your responsibility for meeting these deadlines and letting your
  coauthors know about them (including your forgetful professor).  I
  suggest creating an calendar invite (e.g., at UMD, Google Calendar)
  and invite all of your coauthors to these deadlines so that they
  don't forget (this includes, again, your forgetful professor).

  <h4> Anonymity deadline </h4>

  This is the timeline if we are submitting to ArXiv before submitting
  to the conference.  If this isn't the case, then these deadlines
  become the main conference timeline (in addition to those deadlines).
  
  <ol>
    <li> Three weeks before the deadline: an outline and
    introduction using my preamble and Makefile, determine the author
    list and author order (this can change, but good to get this down
    early).  If there are less involved authors, get an affirmative
    response from each of them that they wish to be authors.  If you
    do not get a reply, they are not an author.
    <li> Two weeks before the deadline: draft of everything but
    the results
    <li> One week before the deadline: complete draft including
    results, figures generated by figures.R or figures.py
    <li> Day of deadline: make a social media post talking about the
    main points of the publication for both a general (top of the
    thread) and technical (bottom of the thread) audience.  Select a
    good figure to attach to the thread.
  </ol>

  <h4> Submission deadline </h4>

  This only applies to papers that were "complete" before this
  deadline.  Either ArXiv preprints or resubmissions.
  
  <ol>
    <li> One month before the deadline: send the paper to people you respect and trust to see if they
    have comments
    <li> Three weeks before the deadline: clean up your code and replicate your results (undoing any
    last-minute hacks)
    <li> Two weeks before the deadline: Look through other papers to see if there are new
    things to cite, remind all authors of the submission and how to contribute.
    <li> One week before the deadline: incorporate all coauthor comments.
    <li> One day before the deadline, make sure you have a conforming
    submission, you have filled out all of the metadata, and you have
    everything ready to submit.  If the conference allows you to
    revise a submission, submit your current draft.
    <li> Go through the <A HREF="#Checklist">submission checklist</A>
  </ol>


  <h4> Author response deadline </h4>

  <ol>
    <li> Once reviews are available: put all of them in a Google Doc.
    Structure the Google Doc as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> Response draft comes first. Copy the form and instructions from the
conference manager form as closely as possible (list word/character
limits, have a single cell table for text boxes to make it clear what
      gets copy/pasted later).
      <li> Then put the reviews after a pagebreak (Insert -> Break -> Page).Â  You can add comments either as first-order comments in the Google Doc or as differently colored text, regardless,
make it clear that any of your comments are not part of the review
typographically.
      <li> Title the document as YYYY VENUE AR: Title of Paper
      <li> Share with all co-authors.Â  Specifically for me, please
    share with ying@umd.edu (and not jbg@umics.umd.edu), as that's
      associated with a Google account.
    </ul>
    <li> Three days before deadline: Have a draft of the author
    response ready
    <li> One day before deadline: If site allows resubmission, park a copy of your response
  </ol>

  
  <h4> Camera-ready deadline </h4>

  <P>First, congrats! It's great that your paper has been accepted. Your work isn't done yet. Do not ignore these steps. They are very important for you to take ownership of the paper, make sure that your reputation will be safe, and to keep your advisor and funders happy.</P>
  
  <ol>
    <li> Immediately (within three days) upon notification:
      <ul>
	<li> Review the comments on the paper from coauthors
	<li> Turn the reviews into todo lists and order everything starting with easy / obvious things and going down the list to impossible / difficult / things you disagree with (call the items generated from the first two items TODO)
	<li> Make a list of relevant papers that have come out since you submitted (call this list CITE)
	<li> Add author names and acknowledgements
	<li> Link the todo from the <A HREF="#Tracker">paper token tracker</A>
	<li> Make sure your <A HREF="#Vector">vector figures</A> are generated
    programatically from files in the repository using either ggplot2
    or plotnineRun the style checker on the source.  (This should have
    been done before, but there's no excuse now.)
      </ul>
      <li> Within five days:
      <ul>
	<li> Do any trivial TODOs
	<li> Discuss prioritization with the senior authors
	<li> Update the related work from the CITE list
	<li> Proofread everything
	<li> Move anything that was cut at the last minute
	<li> Make sure there are no style issues flagged
      </ul>
      <li> Two weeks before the deadline, create a version of the document that:
        <ul>
	  <li> Addresses all of the trivial issues from the TODO list and CITE list
	  <li> Has everything spell-checked and typos corrected (do
	  not neglect the style check, and review all of this webpage)
	  <li> Also has <A HREF="#AdaptFigures">presentation versions</A> of all of the figures in
    the paper.  This may result in better figures overall, so it's
    good to do it now.
	  <li> Has everyone's name is added to author list and spelled correctly (if there's any doubt, ask)
	  <li> Uses the right LaTeX style file (it sometimes changes between submission and camera ready)
Cite any recent work that's relevant and has come out (or you learned about) since you submitted
	  <li> Has no widows or orphans
	</ul>
	<li> In the rest of the time left:
	<ul>
	  <li> Send the document to other folks to read over (you must do this if there are any coauthors not deeply involved in the writing process, but also a good idea to send to relevant people who might have feedback on paper, e.g. if you built heavily on someone else's work)
	  <li> Carefully incorporate their suggestions - don't let the document leave a camera ready state
Work on any of the more difficult TODOs
	  <ul>
	 <li> Once you submit the camera ready:
	    <ul>
	      <li> Put it on your webpage and send the final PDFs to
	      the authors
	      <li> Make a pull request on <A
    HREF="https://github.com/ezubaric/jbg-web/tree/master/pubs">my
    webpage</A> to add an entry, look at other examples to see what's
	      needed: the relevant project, links to code, and an
    accessible abstract.
	      <li> Notify your department's publication mailing list
	      <li> Update your CV
	      <li> Post any associated data and code on your webpage
	      <li> Move the paper to our publications repo
	    </ul>
  </ol>
  
  <h4> Video deadline </h4>

  <p>Unfortunately, conferences are giving less and less time for
  this.  So if you want to do something ambitious, it's good to have
  practiced this and have an idea before the deadline is announced.
  The guidelines here are written with a really short timeline in
  mind, but hopefully you'll have more time than this.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li> Continuously: <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhtDkEKSZog">Get inspired by other videos</A>
    <li> Three weeks before the deadline: Create a script / storyboard
    for the video in Google Docs (add these links to the paper token tracker).  It's okay if it's short.  Just hit what you need
    to do, and share that with all coauthors.
    <li> Two weeks before the deadline: Create slides to accompany the
    script (if needed).  This may require adjusting the script.
    <li> Ten days before the deadline: <A HREF="#Video">record the video</A>
    <li> One week before the deadline: Create a rough cut of the
    edited video in Premiere, share with coauthors (source shared with
    Google Drive)
  </ol>

    <h4> Conference presentation </h4>

  <ol>
    <li> Three weeks before conference: share draft of poster / slides
    <li> Two weeks: practice presenting
    <li> One week: Revamp social media post from ArXiv deadline, attach to paper token
    tracker
    <li> Day before: Post reminder of when / where talk is on social
    media
    <li> Day after: Follow up with the most interested people you
    interacted with
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Writing a Results Section</h3>

  Here's a recipe for writing your results section:
  <ol>
    <li> Figure out the 3--4 things you'd want people to take away
  from the results in the paper </li>
  <li> Create subsection titles that summarize those findings </li>
  <li> Each subsection should describe what you did, but more
  importantly, help the reader interpret how the results get you to
  the findings you want the user to come to the same conclusion that
  you did.  It's not enough to explain what you did and expect the
  tables/figures to speak for themselves. </li>
  </ol>
  
<h3>Error Analysis</h3>

<p>When writing a paper with an objective measure of success or
failure, it is important to include an error analysis.  This is
helpful for multiple reasons: it shows that you've actually looked at
your data, that you understand what your algorithm is doing, and you
know how your method is better (or at least different) from other
algorithms.</p>

<p>For example, let's say that you're doing a paper on word
segmentation and you're comparing to
the <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/Pubs/pedersen-last-word-2008.pdf">Zigglebottom
segmenter</a>.  One thing you can do is sort all of your sentences by
the following metric: #words you got right - #words Zigglebottom got
right.  You should look at both extremes.  Are there patterns in the
things you get right and they get wrong?  If so, that likely reveals
something about what your algorithm is doing.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you're writing a paper on a well-known task / method,
you risk a reviewer reading it and saying, okay, I might do slightly
better, but why?  Are there pitfalls I should be aware of? It also
makes sure you understand what you're claiming better, which allows
you to write a better paper overall.</p>

<p>Moreover, good error analysis
can <a href="http://socleopard.blogspot.com/2014/09/error-analysis-of-week-ratnaparkhi-on.html">improve
your model</a>.</p>

<p>Do not make broad claims like "our algorithm works well on
long-term promises and apologies" without backing it up.  Make it
clear that you've done your homework.  You can be inspired by
examples, but back it up with numbers / statistics from your data: "of
messages with X, our method gets Y correct, while humans only get
Z".</p>

<h3>Writing an Author Response Document</h3>

<p>Take a look this longer document from <a href="https://medium.com/@deviparikh/how-we-write-rebuttals-dc84742fece1">Devi</a> (I disagree with directly quoting, I prefer paraphrasing).</p>

<p>For some conferences and most journals, you will have the
opportunity to respond the the reviews you've received.  This often
doesn't matter.  Many times the reviewers all loved or hated your
paper.  You don't have much of a chance to change their minds.
However, when your paper gets marginally positive reviews or one
outlier review, a good response can really help.</p>

<p>First, be as brief and civil as possible.  If you don't have much
to say, don't try to fill the space.  Only use as much of the allotted
space as you actually need.  If there are no statements of facts you
can offer to help clarify a reviewer's opinion, then just let it go.
Make sure to thank the reviewers and to be gracious.  They may be
idiot numbskulls who trashed your paper, but they did so as a
volunteer.  If they didn't understand something, it's usually your
fault for not writing it well in the first place.</p>

<p>Second, make your response as self-contained as possible.  The PC
will read your response by itself.  They should be able to get the
gist of the reviewer's opinions through your response <b>and</b>
understand your reply without looking anywhere else.  Obviously you
cannot include all necessary details, but make sure your response
  stands on its own as a single, coherent document.</p>

  <pre>
    Reviewer Three questions whether the Pope is Catholic.  We follow
    the convention of Captain Obvious (2003), which has been the
    foundation of many subsequent papers.
  </pre>

<p>If you don't do this, then the AC has to go back and read the
review to know what you're responding to.  You want the AC to spend as
little time reading this bad review as possible!  Let them read your
response instead (and it will be more reasonable, better written,
nicer, etc.).</p>
  
<p>Don't get this wrong by writing your response as an inline e-mail.
It's an inefficient use of space and you can better frame the issues
than the reviewers.  (It may be helpful to compose the response next to
the reviews, but don't assume that the reader will have access to that
information.)</p>

<p>One way of structuring paragraphs in a response is:
  <ul>
    <li> What is the complaint / issue (and who raised it)
    <li> Is it true and/or important?
    <li> Give evidence for that position or why you did what you did.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Even if you don't get to write a response, once you get a set of reviews, create a
spreadsheet (shared with co-authors on Google Docs) to address the issues that
the reviewers found with the following columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <i>Reviewer ID</i>: Even if you know who it is (e.g., from a paper
  clinic, it's probably better to turn these into numbers).
  <li> <i>Issue</i>: If it's a typo, note the typo. If it's something bigger,
  like a characterization issue, copy-paste or paraphrase.
  <li> <i>Notes</i>: Write down anything that might be relevant to jog your
  memory if you come back to it later (e.g., related work, a paper that does
  this well, etc.).
  <li> <i>Difficulty</i>: On a scale of 0 (fix a typo) to 10 (rewrite all the
  things!), how hard do you anticipate the fix being? This will become quite
  important in a few moments, so be honest!
  <li> <i>Fix</i>: How can you fix the issue? A very important note here: "I'm
  not going to fix it" is a perfectly legitimate response!
  <li> <i>Who</i>: For multi-author papers, keep have the first author assign
  responsibility to each of the authors.
  <li> <i>Done</i>: Has this been addressed?  For non-trivial stuff, explain how
  the problem was solved.
</ul>

<p>Other than organizational fixes (which should be done first), it's
often easier to go in increasing order of difficulty.  Lots of little
fixes can sometimes fix bigger issues as you work your way through.
This spreadsheet will also help to write a response document (more
important for journals than conferences).</p>


<h3><A NAME="Checklist">Checklist before submitting something</A></h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Look over your citations.  Do they look uniform?  Sometimes when you
    copy/paste a bibtex citation, you get a messy entry.  In addition,
  now is a good time to make sure you followed all of the <A
  HREF="#Citation">citation best practices</A>.
    <li> Read over your section titles.  Do they tell a story?  Don't just use
    "introduction", "background", "model", "inference", "conclusion", etc.
    While your sections may map to those, call them something more
    specific.
    <li> Make sure your section and subsection titles have correct and
  consistent capitalization (check the template for examples)
    <li> Do your figures stand on their own?  Make sure a bored reader /
    reviewer can get the gist of what's going on through the figures alone.  So if your first figure is about the data you use, make sure that motivates the method you'll use.  If you have a figure of the graphical model, don't just say "our graphical model"; instead, point out the salient aspects of the model that makes it interesting to a reader under time pressure.  If you have a figure of results, don't just say "summary of results"; instead, point out what the results mean in the caption.  You'll say something similar in the text, so don't repeat yourself.  Likely there are different interesting trends you can point out.
    <li> Is your abstract persuasive and interesting?  When an area chair reads it, will they send it to the reviewers that you want?
    <li> Do a spellcheck!
    <li> If you have one subsection, you must have at least two
    <li> Double check that you're using the correct style file; put it
  next to other submissions and make sure they look the same (same
  numbers of lines per page, etc.).
    <li> Make sure you've spelled your co-authors' names correctly (not always
    obvious; perhaps they use middle initials or a different name / spelling for
    publishing) and you have the correct affiliation (did they move since you
    first wrote the paper)?
  </ol>

  <h3>Whew, I just submitted!  Time to forget about the paper until reviews come back ... </h3>

<p>Not so fast!  You likely cut some corners in submitting the paper.
While things are still fresh in your brain, fix things now so that you
can be prepared when the paper is accepted or you work toward
resubmission.  Sometimes the submission site will open back up; be
prepared to take advantage of that.  Or you may want to post on
ArXiV after submission/rejection; fix these problems first.</p>

<ol>
  <li> If you disobeyed the style guidelines on this page, fix those issues now.
  Common things that people fail to do: not have figures
  auto-generated, explicit lists of contributions, not run the style checking script, non-vector figures, ugly tables, ugly
  bibliographies, etc.  You'll have to do it eventually, save yourself
    some hassle and get it done now.
  <li> Add in error bars (e.g., multiple runs) and hyperparameter
    sensitivities now that the cluster is free again.
  <li> Document your code for release, make sure you can rerun all of
    your experiments with a single push of a button.
  <li> Address all of my remaining comments and see if there are people you should send it to for review (if nothing else, pass it around CLIP).
</ol>
  
<h3>Camera Ready</h3>

<p>First, congrats! It's great that your paper has been accepted. Your
work isn't done yet. Do not ignore these steps. They are very
important for you to take ownership of the paper, make sure that your
reputation will be safe, and to keep your advisor and funders
happy.</p>

<p>There is no excuse for leaving this until the last minute.  You've
already done the work, and this is the last chance to get it right.
I've increasingly had the issue of having students ignore this.</p>

<ol> <li> Immediately (within one week), do the following:
    <ol> <li> Have your
	advisor give notes on the current draft of the paper
      <li> Add acknowledgements
to anyone who helped you at any point while working on the paper.  Read an early
draft, provided data, provided help, had interesting discussions with, etc.
<li> Add an appropriate acknowledgement to the grant funding you (use previous
papers as an example).  For my students, find your project on my <a
 href="projects.html">projects</a> page, ask about anything you're unsure of.
     <li> Turn the reviews into todo lists and order everything starting with easy /
obvious things and going down the list to impossible / difficult / things you
disagree with (call the items generated from the first two items TODO)

  <li> Make a list of relevant papers that have come out since you
submitted (call this list CITE).  Look through other papers accepted
to the same conference, look at people you cited in the submission
(have they done any followups), do a search on Google Scholar and
ArXiv.  You always forget to cite something, so I will be very
suspicious if your references don't change going into the camera
ready. </li>

  <li> Move the paper to a public publications repo to make it easier for people
to read drafts and make suggestions.</li>

</ol>

<li> Within two weeks, meet with your advisor to select:
<ol>
<li> What things out of TODO are trivial
<li> See if they have other things to add to the list
<li> What citations to add from your CITE list
</ol>

<li> Within three weeks (or at least two weeks before the camera ready deadline), create a version of the document that:
<ol>
<li> Addresses all of the trivial issues from the TODO list and CITE
list
<li> Has everything spell-checked and typos corrected
<li> Has everyone's name is added to author list and spelled correctly
(if there's any doubt, ask)
<li> Obeys the space limits  
<li> Uses the right style file (it sometimes changes between
submission and camera ready)
<li> Has no widows or orphans
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="../images/widow-orphan.png">
</CENTER>
<li> More broadly, the paper should look like the published papers on my webpage (hopefully better).  Every commit should be something that can be posted immediately. <font size="+3">Do not let the paper leave a camera-ready state.</font>
</ol>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<li>In the rest of the time left:
<ol>
<li> Send the document to other folks to read over (you must do this
if there are any coauthors not deeply involved in the writing process)
<li> Carefully incorporate their suggestions, but don't ever let the
document leave a camera ready state
<li> Work on any of the more difficult TODOs
</ol>

<li>Once you submit the document:
<ol>
<li> Put it on your webpage and send the final PDFs to the authors
<li> Notify your department's publication mailing list
  <li> Update your CV
  <li> Make a <a
  href="https://tipbox.abcam.com/twitter-tips-for-academics-how-to-tweet-about-your-publication/">Tweet
  about the paper</a> (mention me and I'll retweet)
  <li> Make sure the final PDF is pdf/a compatible including the
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/">appropriate
package</a> (preferred), using <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/pdf-x-pdf-a-pdf.html">Acrobat</a>, a
web tool, or <a href="https://twitter.com/tallinzen/status/1362568292309860353">Ghostscript</a>.  
<li> Post any associated data and code on your webpage
</ol>

</ol>


<h3>Talks</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Read these general advice pieces from <a href="http://kbsgk12project.kbs.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/David-Attenborough-style-of-scientific-speaking.pdf">Will Ratcliff</a>, <a
  href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9703019v1.pdf">Robert Geroch</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-give-a-talk.html">Jason</a>.
  <li> Use Beamer and OmniGraffle (but keep your Beamer slides
  uncluttered with navigation and sections).
  <li> Don't use a laser pointer (integrate any emphasis into your
  slides).  People have a tendency to over-use laser pointers, and
  they are not always usable (because of the screen, multiple screens,
  etc.).

  <li> Don't read from notes (and don't use your slides as notes).  If
  you feel uncomfortable delivering the talk, it means you need to
  practice more.

  <li> If you can ever use a picture instead of an equation, choose
  the picture (even if it takes more time).

  <li> Think about your color palette.  Have one to two main colors
  and use them everywhere: figures, pictures, bullets, titles,
  backgrounds (schools / labs likely have their own favored colors
  ... just use those and don't think about it).

  <li> <A NAME="AdaptFigures"></A>You're likely going to going to adapt figures from your paper.
  That's fine, but talks are a different medium.  Usually, you want to
  gradually reveal aspects of the figure so you can focus attention on
  what you're talking about.  Usually, you'll show far <b>less</b>
  information than you did in your paper.  You almost never want to
  copy a big results table verbatim from your paper.

<h3>Posters</h3>

	<p>Here's a video that proposes something very different from
	what we normally do.  I'm not sure I agree or endorse it, but
	it's a good way of thinking about the failure modes.  We
	should do better about conveying the main points and not being
	so cluttered.  It is very useful to think about what your
	giant takeaway message is and that should indeed probably be
	in giant font on your poster.</p>
	<CENTER>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1RwJbhkCA58" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	</CENTER>
	<p>Without adopting this format completely, I would suggest
	the following: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li> The title (the really big text) doesn't need to match
	  your paper's title.  Think about what's relevant to the
	  audience and what's new about your paper (just like in the
	  video above).
	  <li> Optimize your poster for skimming.  Don't have too much
	  text.  Most things should be pictures / diagrams (with big
	  fonts).
	  <li> Have pictures for anything that you might mention.
	</ul>

<p>More generally, optimize your poster for both the average case
(someone standing there for four minutes) and for the tails (world
expert who wants to drill into details).</p>
<ol>
  <li> Practice a four minute version of your talk (no more!) that gives the highlights of your paper and teases about what additional areas of detail that you can go into if people want to have a conversation.  Figure out the slides you'd want to have for that four minute version and make that the centerpiece of your poster.
  <li> Read this <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/05/11/how-to-design-an-award-winning-conference-poster/">General Advice</a>
  <li> Use Beamer
  <li> Use blocks with informative titles (just like section headings)
  <li> Do not put two images / tables in a block unless they are
  showing <b>very</b> related information (e.g., don't put results from two
  different datasets in the same block).
  <li> Use a color scheme consistent with your institution; look at
  previous posters from the group before you begin.

</ol>

<h3><A NAME="Videos">Videos</A></h3>

<CENTER><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLlrpro0zQE?si=CuImBVzV4XI4zICh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></CENTER>

<p>Even before Coronavirus, conferences were asking participants to make a video teaser for
a paper.  This is a handy way to also practice a short pitch for your
poster.  Now, many talks are only given through videos. I think this is a great opportunity, as I describe in this video:</p>

<CENTER>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQAXiR6R9sI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</CENTER>

<ol>
  <li> Figure out who is going to be in the video.  If professors are involved, find a time now because scheduling may prevent them from taking part.
  <li> Write a script first.  It takes longer if you ad lib and screw
  things up constantly.  Don't assume that you'll do it correctly in
  one take: you'll record each section multiple times and take the
  best one.
  <li> Be completely sure that your script fits into the time allowed.  It makes life very hard on the editor if they have to cut actual content.	  
  <li> If you're pressed for time and at UMD, you may want to record in a <A HREF="https://faculty.umd.edu/1button-studios">one button studio</a>.
  <li> Make sure you have good lighting.  Try to find an east-facing
  window in the morning or a west-facing window in the afternoon.  Put
  the camera a little bit above eye level.  You don't want to record
  from a laptop on a desk: good for working, but not for creating a
    video. A laptop on a big pile of books is good, though.
  <br/>

    </CENTER>
  <li> If you can, you also want to have "bounce" lighting from below.
  You can get this by putting a white tablecloth (or sheet) on the
  desk in front of you.
  <li> This video is a good discussion of how to fix problems in
  videos.  However, the moral of the story should be to get it right
  during filming; it's far less work!</li>
  <CENTER>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3yprYosMmQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </CENTER>
  <li> While it's good to script videos, the actual reading can feel too scripted.  Think about the emotion of the lines as you read
  them, and memorize enough so that you're constantly looking at the
  camera as you read it.
  <li> Apart from investing in a smartphone teleprompter, one way of
  making a script is to pair up with someone else.  Thanks to editing
  magic, you can make this more natural via the following:
  <ol>
    
    <li> The idea is we'd want to do compositing so that it looks like
    people are talking to each other in the same room (agree with your
    conversation partner who is on the left and who is on the right
    and on the height of the camera from ground, probably 2m-ish).
    This can either be done by splicing or with green screen.
    Splicing could work well if people can agree on similar
    backgrounds (e.g., water / mountains / blank white wall).

    <CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="../images/camera_positioning.png" ALT="Have your camera
    (1m away) point to a point between where the two people would be if they
    were in the same room separated by 1m.">
    </CENTER>
    <li> Put the script far enough away from your face that the camera
    can't see your <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccades</A> as you read.
	    
    <li> Slides should be in 4:3 format so we can insert (for YouTube)
    the slides between the people (which assumes 16:9 ratio by
    default).

    <li> I think it's better if people are standing, but only do that
    if you're comfortable.  Have a stuffed animal or something where
    your virtual conversation partner will be so that you can make
    "eye contact" with them.

    <li> For actual recording, you should do it offline on laptop or
    phone (if you don't have camera and tripod).  Don't use a laptop's internal camera (more on this below).  If you're recording with someone else, to make sure the
    reactions are natural, you should call the other person in
    conversation on a *separate* device and record simultaneously.

    <li> Stop every five minutes or so to make sure the recording has
    worked okay (both video and sound).  

  </ol>
  <li> If you're not trying to merge your video with someone else's
  else video, have an interesting but not distracting background.  Shelves
  full of books, nature scenes, or cityscapes work well.  (You can
  also have a blank "void" as a background, but I think a more
  interesting background works better.)
    <ol>
      <li> If you don't like your background, don't use polygons to cut it out.
      <li> If you want to remove the background, use a greenscreen
      technique (you can do this with a green sheet fairly cheaply).
      <li> Make sure your background doesn't match the color of your shirt, hair, or skin.
    </ol>
  <li> Use a higher resolution for recording so that you can have
  different zooms to give a little bit of variety in the final edited
  version.  Focus on who is speaking, have different levels of zoom to
  hide cuts for content / mistakes. <br/>
    <CENTER>

    </CENTER>
  <li> Have a good condenser microphone either in front of you or on
  your lapel / collar.  Also make sure that you don't have sounds in
  the background (construction, cat, etc.).  These are usually not
  expensive, but are a fantastic investment.  A big, bulky, cheap
  microphone is way better than what's built into your computer (size
  matters).  Sometimes microphones will require a battery; if so, make
  sure the battery is turned on and you have the correct battery.
  <li> Wear darker colors (orange, brown, grey) and make sure your
  clothes have a solid pattern (no plaid, etc.).
  <li> For research teasers, go no more than three minutes.
  <li> Create the words first, then back up the words with images.
  For example, if you're talking about pottery from Delft and
  comparing it with a collection in the Forbidden City, show them!
  <li> Don't be limited to slides, use film / animations if you can:
  make full use of the medium!  Similarly, you can get many people to
  make clips for your video.  You can divide up the work and add variety!
  <li> Look directly at the camera: be natural on the camera and make
  sure you use the full intonation of your voice.  Practicing reading
  books to young children helps with this. <br/>

    </CENTER>
  <li> Record yourself saying every sentence multiple times so you
  have options.  Pick the one that worked best. <br/>

  <li> Talk naturally, but with a little more energy than you would
  normally.
  <li> Record the slides using a screen recorder (e.g., <A HREF="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</A>) and combine them with your face later.
  <li> I prefer placing slides <b>over</b> the presenter rather than
  putting the presenter(s) inside the videos with the slides.

<h3>Personal Statements</h3>

  <li> No sentence should be something that more than five people
  could write.  Either it's not specific/detailed enough, or it's a
  cliche.

<ol>

  <li> <b>Introduction</b> 

  <p>Now, it may seem that your PhD was just
  bouncing around between a set of different topics/projects.  But
  there often is a reason that you moved from one project to another,
  and with the advantage of hindsight, you can tell a story about why
  that happened.</p>

  <p>Think creatively about a narrative that connects all of your work
  together.  It may not be chronological!  It's possible that later
  work helps explain why earlier work was a good idea in the first
  place; it's fine to order things differently, and the introduction
  is a way for you to explain how things actually fit together.</p>

  <p>Don't put too much background material in the intro chapter.  That
  comes later.  It's good to have citations, but the traditional CS
  citations can go in the next chapter.  Challenge yourself to cite
  papers and people you haven't cited before.</p>

  <p>Pretend that you're a historian piecing together your papers.  You
  believe there was a reason this great scientist worked on X, Y, and
  Z.  Come up with a good story about it!</p>

  </li>
  
  <li> <b>Background</b>

  <p>The background chapter is in many ways the
  most important chapter.  Write it as if you had a time machine and
  you were going to send back a document to yourself to speed along
  your PhD.  What are all of the things you would need to know to get
  it done in, say, a year.  This is what should go in the background
  chapter: all of the stuff you wish you knew before you did all this
  research but that you didn't learn in your undergrad.</p>

  <p>However, this isn't just a list.  You need to figure out
  <i>how</i> to explain it well.  Are there connections between these
  things that you hadn't seen before?  Don't just regurgitate the
  places you learned it from; write it in the way that makes sense for
  your dissertation.</p>

  <p>For example, Mohit Iyyer created a bunch of reference
  implementations of deep learning models for text (circa 2015) and
  created a background chapter that covered all of them with coherent,
  consistent notation organized a sentiment analysis / political
  polarity example.  This was both coherent and concrete.</p></li>

  <li> <b>Copy/Paste</b>

  <p>After you get to the content chapters, you
  may think that you're home free.  Just copy/paste the papers you've
  written, right?  While there is a lot of content you can reuse, I'd
  suggest the following:</p>
  <OL>
    <LI> Delete your introduction and conclusion

    <LI> Make all of the notation consistent between chapters
  (corollary: make notation between papers as consistent as possible)

    <LI> Remove all references to "This Paper", replace with "This
  Chapter"

    <LI> Replace references to your other papers with the appropriate
  chapters, and provide more contrast than you would in a paper.

    <LI> Your background section is tricky: most of it should be in
  your background chapter.  If there's something that isn't in the
  background chapter for a good reason, think carefully where it
  should go: another chapter (e.g., it's more connected to another
  paper) or this chapter (e.g., a section devoted just to that
  concept).

    <LI> You can never say "because of space restrictions" in a
    thesis.  Many of the things that were in an appendix should now be
    in the main text.  Only if they're really boring should they not
    go in (but if they're important, try to make them interesting!).

  </OL></LI>
  
  <li> <b>Conclusion</b>: Pretend that you're starting up a new
  research group at a university/company.  You have a five person team
  that you need to provide with work.  What directions would you
  extend from your research?  </LI>
</ol>

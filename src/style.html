<p>When writing a document, there are many stylistic choices that are
relatively arbitrary.  I collect the arbitrary choices that I've made
in the course of my writing here both for my own reference and for my
students.  Many of these
are <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>-specific.</p>

<p>You'll likely disagree with much of what I say here.  In fact, I disagree
with some of it; sometimes the choices here reflect compromises done to minimize
friction with co-authors or choices made to minimize paper length (e.g.,
removing ISBNs from references).  Please do not point out places in papers where
I've deviated from these.  Sometimes I have good reasons for deviating: my style
is evolving, my co-authors wouldn't accept my conventions, or the journal
stipulated something different.  I also realize that, as with every document on
writing, there will be typos and mistakes here.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out Neil
Spring's <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nspring/software/style-check-readme.html">useful
resources</a> (including a script you can use with flymake when
editing LaTeX documents).  I disagree with the following rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li> I use the British convention for quote marks (which makes more
sense to computer scientists, as below).
  <li> "sufficient" is a fine word (esp. for "sufficient statistics")
  <li> "<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/">Teh</a>" is almost never a
  mispelling when I write it
</ol>
<p>The rest is great, however, and you should use it (with the above edits).
For my students, this is included as part of the Makefile for generating papers.
Look at the end of compilation to see the red flags that it has discovered.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/styleguide/introduction">The Economist
style guide</a> is a good resource for exposing bad habits, and their
conventions are reasonable.  However, they are a British publication, so ignore
British-specific rules (I do have some other points of disagreement, such as
infinitives).</p>

<p>Specifically for scientists, <a
  href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/contents">Nature
 has good resources</a>.  Specifically for NLP, <a
  href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/writing_advice.html">Philip</a> and <a
  href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html">Jason</a>
 have good advice.  For machine learning, there's even official <a
  href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2015/PaperInformation/EvaluationCriteria">NIPS
 advice</a>.</p>

<h3>Why LaTeX?</h3>

<p>Sometimes I get asked by a new collaborator why I use LaTeX.  The
bad reason is that it's a convention.  It's quite obvious when a paper
is not written in LaTeX, and in many scientific fields, it's a sign
that you're not really part of the community: papers not written in
LaTeX are greeted with more skepticism than papers that are (and often
with good reason, non-LaTeX papers usually are worse than LaTeX ones
in my reviewing experience; not a rule, but a useful heuristic).</p>

<p>But these are social reasons to use LaTeX, and are not particularly
convincing for pragmatic reasons.  So here are some pragmatic reasons
to use LaTeX instead of Word.</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Equations and Math</b>: LaTeX was designed to give clear and
  effective renderings of math.  Word does a poor job of both making
  math look good and allowing you to edit the math later.  You can
  make equations look good, but it's hard to edit.  Word also makes it
  very difficult to have inline math, as it often screws up the
  spacing between the lines.
    <pre>
      The density $\rho$ gives us the resistance $R=\rho L$ of the
      material.
    </pre>
  <li> <b>Templates</b>: Most venues provide LaTeX templates as their
  standard templates.  These are much easier to use than Word
  templates, which require far more fiddling.
  <li> <b>You Do Less</b>: In Word, you are tempted to move images and
  figures around to determine the placement.  This is because word
  gives you that flexibility, and it's hard to ignore the siren call
  of tweaking.  In LaTeX, you provide suggestions on placement and it
  does the best it can based on pre-programmed rules (e.g., you tell
  it that it should be at the top or bottom of a page).
  <li> <b>References</b>: One of my biggest annoyances when I am
  forced to work in Word is how hard it is to easily refer to
  different chapters, citations, or figures in a way that will be
  automatically generated.  I know there are ways to do it, but it
  often has huge issues and requires obnoxious plugins.  In most cases
  it is either done manually or requires substantial post-correction.
  LaTeX does all of these automatically, and it just works.
  <li> <b>Macros</b>: More generally, skilled LaTeX writers develop a
  set of macros that vastly improves productivity and consistency.
  These range from typsetting conventions references (e.g., to the
  name of your approach, institutions, etc.).  Because LaTeX makes it
  easy to import files, you can share references across many documents
  that you're working on at the same time.
  <li> <b>Collaboration</b>: Because LaTeX is just text files and it
  is easy to include on file in another, you can use tools like git to
  work with others as you create your paper.
  <li> <b>Cost</b>: Unlike Word, it's free and open source.  LaTeX
  hasn't changed much in 20 years, so you can still read and compile
  papers without anything being messed up.  Word changes every five
  minutes.
  <li> <b>Accessibility</b>: When I communicate with blind
  researchers, they always ask if I have a LaTeX version.  They can
  write and read LaTeX much more easily than Word or PDF (especially
  when there's math; screen readers always screw up embedded equations
  in Word).
</ul>

<p>If you're going to ignore my advice, at
least <a href="http://jeffhuang.com/better_word_papers.html">make your Word
documents look nice</a> (but it's a lot of work).</p>

<h3>Tense</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Almost everything should be in the present tense
  <li> This includes related work (even super old stuff like Aristotle)
  <li> This includes generative processes
  <li> It's okay to use the future tense for future work
</ol>

<h3>Punctuation</h3>

<ol>

  <li> Don't put footnotes on a number (it looks like an exponent).
  <li> Put footnotes <b>immediately</b> after sentence / clause
  punctuation.  Do not put footnotes before final punctuation (common
  mistake).
    <pre>
      I'm never ever sick at sea.\footnote{Well, hardly ever.}
    </pre>

  <li> Do not use a comma between two verb phrases (no subject) joined by a conjunction.

     <pre>
       I washed the car and mowed the lawn.
     </pre>

  <li> Do use a comma between two independent clauses (subject and verb) joined by a conjunction.

     <pre>
       I washed the car, and I mowed the lawn.
     </pre>

  <li> Use an Oxford comma to set off the penultimate element in a list.</li>

    <pre>
      I had eggs, toast, and orange juice
    </pre>

  <li> Use LaTeX hyphens (-), en dashes (--), and em dashes (---) correctly

    <pre>
      This is a low-budget trip, and pages 78--101 describe the
      journey.  If the train is on time---which it never is---we'll
      get there tomorrow.
    </pre>

<CENTER>
<iframe width="280" height="176" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnAaywvd1uk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</CENTER>

  <li> Put punctuation outside quotes (British / Canadian style, not American).
  Also make sure that your quotes go in the right direction; don't draft in MS
  Word and copy paste into a TeX document.  If you do, your quotes will be
  wrong (TeX uses different symbols for left and right quotes).

    <pre>
      In civilized cultures, this is called a ``coaster''.
    </pre>

  <li> Similarly, I use <i>M-x q</i> to word wrap paragraphs in emacs.  Like two
  spaces after a sentence, it looks better in editing but has no impact on
  layout (more practically, it helps you estimate text length while editing).

</ol>

<h3>Figures</h3>

   <ol>
      <li> If a figure has a caption, use the top or bottom
      positioning.  Center the actual image, and be sure to provide a
      label.

        <pre>
	\begin{figure}[tb]
	  \begin{center}
	  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{2015_hoverboard/awesome}
	  \end{center}
	  \caption{Jetpacks are next.}
	  \label{fig:hoverboards}
	\end{figure}
	</pre>

      <li> If the figure has no caption, you can use "here".
      <li> Make sure the caption stands on its own.  When a reviewer
      first sees a paper, they will often just skim the figures.  Make
      sure that if a reader does this they will get a sense of what
      the paper is about and the clear takeaway from each figure.
      <li> Try to use full sentences in the caption.
      <li> Use raster / vector formats as appropriate.  In general, photos
      should be wavlet formats (jpg), hand-drawn cartoons, logos, or images with
      alpha channels should be low-pallete rasters (png), and everything else
      should be a vector format (pdf/eps).  This is another way that LaTeX is
      far superior to Word, where it's much harder to inser graphics without
      vector formats being lost.  (Omnigraffle and ggplot2 by default create
      vector pdfs; another reason to use them!)

        <CENTER>
          <IMG SRC="../images/vector_raster.gif" ALT="Vector vs. Raster Images">
        </CENTER>

      <li> Don't supply file extensions; pdflatex/latex will choose
      for you (makes it easy to switch between the two).

     <li> Don't use <a
     href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/88929/vertical-table-lines-are-discontinuous-with-booktabs/88939#88939">vertical
     rules in your tables</a>.  It's fine to use shading (light gray).
	<li> When you refer to a figure, don't use "see".  Just put the reference. </li>

	<pre> The FancyPants algorithm can find fancy pants (Figure~\ref{fig:pants}). </pre>

     <li> Use <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> for graphics, and make
     sure <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/mathematical-annotations-on-r-plots/">notation
     is consistent with LaTeX</a>.  Store your data in the same repository as
     your paper and have a Makefile command to regenerate figures from the
     original data.</li>
   </ol>

<h3>Math</h3>

   <ol>
     <li> When in text, spell out all natural numbers less than or equal to one
     hundred.  Also spell out "infinity" unless it's in an equation or an
     algorithm.  Anything else should be represented in decimal unless prefixed
     by the base (e.g., "0b00010").  In general, follow the Chicago style for
     numbers.
       <ol>
         <li> Spell out big round numbers like thousand, billion, etc.
         <li> Never start a sentence with a number represented with numerals.
         <li> It's okay to break these rules to ensure consistency in the same
         sentence or paragraph.  E.g., "The final score was 315 to 10".
         <li> It's okay to use numerals for Likert scales: "5-point scale".
       </ol>

     <li> Do not use
     more <a href="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~vsanni/ph3/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements.pdf">significant
     digits</a> than you need to (or should!).

     <li> Make sure that all equations and math are nouns and are embedded in a sentence with appropriate punctuation.

     <pre>
        The voltage is $V=IR$, where $I$ is the current.
     </pre>

     <li> Do not use phrases like "The entropy is defined as follows" when
     introducing an equation.  "The entropy is" or "we define entropy as" work
     better.

     <li> Remind readers what variables are if you haven't used them in a while.

     <li> When creating a multiline equation, use the align
     environment, and keep the alignment to the <b>right</b> of the
     equals sign.

<pre>
  \begin{align}
    4 = & 2 + 2 \\
      = & 1 + 1 \\
        & + 1 + 1 \\
      = & 4
  \end{align}
</pre>

     <li> If you use <pre>\MoveEqLeft</pre> you're probably using
     align incorrectly.

     <li> Refer to equations as parenthetical appositives or nouns:

       <pre>The gradient (Equation~\ref{eq:grad}) is further simplified in Equation~\ref{eq:simp-grad}.</pre>


     <li> Create macros for the following and use them consistently
       (or ask me for a preamble that defines these things)
       <ol type="a">
	 <li> Underbraces for explaining complicated mathematical concepts
<pre>

         <li> ELBO (for variational inference)
<pre>
\newcommand{\elbo}{\mathcal{L}}
</pre>
       </ol>
    <li> Do not use italics (the default in math mode) for distributions; it helps to define a macro
      <pre>
	\theta \sim \mbox{Dir}(\alpha)
      </pre>
    <li> Don't use a pipe for given; make sure there's space around it
      <pre>
	p(a\, | \,b) = \frac{ \sim p(b\, | \,a) p(a)}{p(b)}
      </pre>
    <li> Don't use default parens for big math items; use automatically
    resized parens

    <li> Don't start sentences with a math symbol.
    <li> Obey <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/courses/6.899/papers/mermin.pdf">Mermin's rules</a>.
      <ol>
	<li> Number all displayed equations
	<li> Have a name for every equation
	<li> Punctuate every equation as prose, treating it as a noun
	</ol>

    <li> Vector/matrix convention (stolen from Yoav Goldberg): Use bold upper
       case letters to represent matrices and bold lower-case letters to
       represent vectors.  Use subscripts to represent entries from those
       vectors and superscripts to identify different flavors (e.g., different times
       or layers).  In the rare case that you exponentiate vectors or matrices,
       put them in parentheses first.  Use a semicolon to denote vector
       concatenation.

        <!--- TODO: put in a table with examples of all of these --->

    </ol>

<h3>References within a document</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Prefix the label of a reference with the type of reference it is (use
    the first three letters of the type of thing it is: fig, tab, sec, etc.).</li>

      <pre>
	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:intro}
      </pre>

    <li> Keep references short and do not include spaces in the label (use
    hyphens if you <b>must</b> have more than one word, but this should be a
    rarity)

      <pre>
	\label{sec:romulan-treaty}
      </pre>

    <li>When using an inline reference, make sure there's a tilde
    between the noun and the number.  This makes sure that this
    doesn't get split between lines (non-breaking space).</li>

      <pre>
	As we show in Section~\ref{sec:intro}, long cat is long.
      </pre>

  </ol>

<h3>Stupid rules you should follow</h3>

  <p>Even though they're not really true, people get twitchy when you abuse them.
  So learn them as rules for professional writing (even though they're
  hogwash).</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Use "fewer" when comparing discrete amounts, and use "less" when
    comparing continuous amounts.

      <pre>
	To weigh less, he should eat fewer donuts.
      </pre>

    <li> Use "that" for restrictive clauses (no commas).  Use "which" for non-restrictive
    clauses (use commas).
      <pre>
	The pizza, which everyone loves, is from Conte's.  The pizza that fell
	on the floor is no longer edible, however.
      </pre>

    <li> Use "who" only with the <a
     href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/who_vs_whom">nominative case</a> (and
    "whom" in other cases).

      <ol>
	<li> who can use this (subject of "can use")
	<li> for whom we designed this (object of preposition)
	<li> who gave a lecture (subject of verb "gave")
	<li> Caltech tenured whom? (object of verb "tenured")

       </ol>
    <li> Only use "data" as a plural noun (with one <a
    href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data">exception</a>).
    <li> Likewise, only use "media" as a plural noun.
    <li> Trickier is "criteria" (plural) and "criterion" (singular):
    "Some good criteria are ..." vs. "A good criterion is ... ".
    Avoid sounding pompus but still be technically correct (the best
    kind of correct) by using "criteria" as a plural noun.
  </ol>

<h3>Anti-rules</h3>

  <p>Some people don't think you should do the following, but I disagree.  Feel
  free to completely ignore these non-rules.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> There's no blanket <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html">prohibition against the passive</a>, but don't use it to obscure agency.
    <li> It's fine to end your sentence with a preposition if it sounds natural.
    <li> It's fine to boldly split an infinitive.
    <li> It's fine (and often better) to use "they" as a singular gender-neutral pronoun.
  </ol>

<h3>Citations</h3>

  <p>Below, I suggest removing valuable metadata.  This is for two
  reasons: space and uniformity.  Unfortunately, the bibliography
  often counts against page length, so we need to keep our
  bibligraphies as short as possible while keeping them useful.
  Because we often have to strip bibtex entries, it helps to
  have <b>everything</b> be compact to preserve uniformity and having
  to do last minute massaging.  Just make everything obey these rules
  when you put it into your bibtex for the first time.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Use bibtex and use it correctly
      <ol>
        <li> Do not abbreviate names (i.e., use "Thomas Stearns Elliot", not
    "T. S. Elliot") in your files.  Bibtex will will do this for you, and you
    will be out of luck if your citation file uses full names (like ACL).
        <li> Make sure that you are using the correct citation type for
        articles, books, chapters, etc.
        <li> Put proper nouns (e.g., "Dirichlet", "Bernoulli", and "Pitman-Yor"
    are all named after people), in your bibtex file in brackets to make sure
    they get capitalized correctly
      <pre>
	title = {Latent {D}irichlet Allocation},
      </pre>

      </ol>

    <li> Define journal and conference names in a different bib file from the
    one you store your references in.  This way you can swap out long form title
    (Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics) with the
    short form title (ACL) if you're tight for space.  Plus, it makes sure your
    citations are consistent.

    <pre>

    </pre>

    <li> Put citations inside the relevant sentence but outside quotes.

    <pre>
      The rug really ``tied the room together''~\cite{dude-98}.
    </pre>

    <li> Do not include page numbers, publishers, or locations for
    conferences (nobody reads the paper versions anyway).

    <li> Do not include volumes for NIPS.  People just use the year.

    <li> Do not include DOIs or ISBNs

    <li> For numeric citation styles (e.g., NIPS), don't use inline citations as nouns; use the name.
      <pre>
        Moseby~\cite{moseby-11} shows that he can pull off red boots.
      </pre>
    <li> For natbib-like citations (e.g. ACL), use citet/newcite to accomplish
      this.  <b>Don't</b> use a non-breaking space in this case.

      <pre>
        \citet{moseby-11} shows that that he can pull off red boots.
      </pre>

    <li> Don't include material that's only title, author, and year.
    That's not enough information to find it.  Make sure you include
    either a web address (ArXiV), a university (theses), or a venue (most things).

    <li> When introducing a paper with, for example, an acronym you'll use
    throughout the paper, put the acronym in the citation brackets.

    <pre>
       We compare word-level represenations~\cite[Word2Vec]{mikolov-13}
       against document-level representations~\cite[\abr{lda}]{blei-03}.
    </pre>

  </ol>

<h3>Typography</h3>

  <ol>
    <li> Put mentions of words in quotes and topics (e.g., from a
    topic model) in underline (topic macro).

      <pre>
        We wanted to understand why the \underline{research} topic has
      high probability for ``procrastination'', but we leave that for
      future work.
      </pre>

    <li> Use small caps for acronyms (it looks better; I create a macro called
    "abr" to make this easier), and don't put periods after the letters in
    acronyms (the reason why: LaTeX uses smart spacing after periods, but
    doesn't handle sentence-final acronyms; this will make your life easier).
      <pre>
	\textsc{tla}s are popular in the \textsc{us} government.
      </pre>
    <li> If you have an abbreviation mid-sentence, make sure LaTeX knows not to
    use sentence final spacing.
      <pre>
        Crosby et al.\ have a very, very, very fine house.
      </pre>

        <li> Because I learned to type on monotype fonts, I will put two spaces
  after a period that ends a sentence.  There's no good reason to do this, but
  LaTeX knows to do the right thing in typesetting.  I continue to do it,
  though, because I think it looks better when editing in emacs with fixed-width
  fonts.  (You don't have to do it, but if you see me doing it, that's why; you
  don't have to worry about it / correct it.)

    <li> Put features (for supervised learning) in monospaced fonts
    (feat macro).

    <pre>
      We the number of words in a document (e.g., \texttt{doclen:13})
      is the final feature.
    </pre>

    <li> If it's allowed (ICML 2013 didn't, for instance), use the
    "times" package for serif fonts.

    <li> For ordinals, write them out if they're less than or equal to one
    hundred.  For ordinals greater than one hundred, use a text superscript.

    <pre>
      The Second Reich loved its 247\textsuperscript{th} pointy helmet design.
    </pre>

    <li> Write ligatures, umlauts, and other diacritics correctly.

      <pre>
	If you want to know what a f\^ete galante looks like to a physicist, look up Schr\"odinger in the Encyclop\ae dia
      </pre>

    <li> If you have a long list of names (e.g., journal title page), use
    non-breaking spaces between name components.

    <pre>
       Herr~Doktor~Professor~Albert~Einstein, Joe~the~Plumber
    </pre>

    <li> Put a non-breaking space between references, citations, and math symbols.  <b>Do not put a space before the non-breaking space;</b> this defeats the purpose.  Your word should end, be followed by a non-breaking space, followed by the reference, citation, or symbol.  This prevents a line breaking between references and the thing they're connected to.</li>

<h3>Word choice</h3>

  <ol>
    <li> Never use the word "performance".  It's likely a stand-in for
    something else (e.g., "accuracy", "latency", or "F1").  Say what
    you actually mean.</li>
    <li> Avoid "perform an X".  X is likely a noun form of a
    verb.  Just use that verb.  Don't "perform a split" or "perform a
    cross-validation" or "perform a song".  Just "split",
    "cross-validate", or "sing".
    <li> Use "first" rather than "firstly" (same for second, third, etc.).
    <li> Use "unlike" rather than "different from".
    <li> Never use "utilize"; always use "use".  Corollary: prefer "usage" over
    "utilization", unless it's a technical term.  Same thing with "leverage" (unless there's
    mechanical advantage involved).
    <li> You can always delete "this means".
    <li> You can always delete "it turns out that".
    <li> You can always replace "in order to" with "to".
    <li> You can always delete "we find that".
    <li> You can always delete "our findings/results suggest that" (and variants)
    <li> You can always replace "to do this we" with "we".
    <li> Use "while" rather than "whereas".
    <li> Don't say "it is well known"; either cite or just state the fact.
    <li> Prefer "toward" over "towards".
    <li> You can almost always delete "notice that" or "note that".  (My dumb fingers are
    often very guilty of writing this.)
    <li> Use "we" rather than "this paper" or "this work".
    <li> Use "shown" over "denoted" or "listed".
    <li> Use "in addition" rather than "besides".
    <li> Use "certainty" rather than "certitude".
    <lu> Unless you're talking about physically knocking someone to the ground,
    don't use the verb "tackle".</li>
    <li> Try not to use "hedging" language (often, probably, etc.).  Either
    something is true or it isn't.  If it really is a mixed bag, quantify the
    amount (e.g., three out of four dentists).
    <li> Avoid the phrase "it has been shown"; if you have nothing more specific
    to say about it (e.g., <b>who</b> showed it), then just remove it.  It's an
    agentless appeal to authority.

    <li> If British and American English use different words, you
    should typically prefer the American ("elevator", "stroller",
    "diaper", "truck").  The exception is when this could lead to
    confusion when one language's term is ambiguous.  In those cases,
    use the version that removes ambiguity.  As a consequence, use the
    British terms "trousers" (not "pants"), "crisps" (not "chips"),
    and "cashpoint" (not "ATM"), but use the American terms "pacifier"
    (not "dummy"), "gasoline" (not "petrol"), "fries" (not "chips"),
    and "cookie" (not "biscuit").  Most of these examples will not be
    relevant in academic writing, but "factoid" is one notable
    example.  British speakers view it as something that
    is <b>untrue</b>.  Try to avoid it if possible.  (I learned about this <a
     href="../docs/2014_emnlp_qb_rnn.pdf">too late</a> from <a
     href="http://www.karlmoritz.com/">KMH</a>).

    <li> I will default to American spelling.  If you send me a
    nearly-complete draft using consistent British spelling, I will
    gladly keep that convention (being an Economist reader finally
    pays off).  If you use Indian or Canadian spelling, experience has
    shown that I will turn it into American spelling as I edit (sorry,
    I just can't keep the intermediate cases straight).

    <li> In academic writing, avoid contractions.

  </ol>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>

  <ol>
    <li> Make sure your paragraphs have <a
    href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/engagement/index.php?category_id=2&sub_category_id=1&article_id=29">topic
    sentences</a>.  Until you have mastered writing paragraphs, you
    shouldn't break this practice.</li>

  </ol>

<h3>Writing a paper Collaboratively</h3>

  <ol>
    <li> Often, when computer scientists work together on a paper, they will
    discuss something using the concept of a "write token".  This concept comes
    from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring">token-ring</a>
    computer network.  The problem is that the computers share the same wires to
    send messages over the network.  If two computers try to send something at
    the same time, it will cause a problem.  The same problem comes up when
    writing a document; if two people try to edit the document at the same time,
    it can cause problems.

    <li> Thus, before editing a file shared in some collaborative environment
    (Dropbox, SVN, etc.), send an e-mail (or some other pre-arranged
    notification) to your coauthors.  Something along the lines of "I'm claiming
    the write tokens for foo.tex".  Then, edit the file to your heart's content,
    save and commit your changes, and then send an e-mail saying "I release the
    write tokens for foo.tex".  Bottom lines: only modify files for which you
    have the write token, and release tokens for any file that you're not
    actively editing.

    <li> As a consequence, it helps to "input" many smaller files to create
    the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents">whole
    document</a>.  This enables co-authors to claim tokens to specific sections
    on a file-by-file basis.  (SVN, CVS, and git allow you to merge files after
    agreeing to the same delineation of write tokens, but this is dangerous; I
    discourage it.)

    <li> Make sure that your text editor notifies you when the underlying file
    changes.  If this doesn't happen, then you might unintentionally clobber
    (overwrite) another's edits.  This happens as follows:
      <ol>
        <li> you edit a file (with your write tokens)

        <li> you save the file, commit, and release the write tokens

        <li> you leave the file open in your editor

        <li> Collaborator Charlie modifies the files

        <li> you update the file on your disk (but leave the file open in your editor)

        <li> you then make some changes to the file (after getting the write tokens)

        <li> and then you save those files, but because your editor never reflected the underlying changes, everything that Charlie did is forgotten

        <li> you commit the changes, and your version control software thinks
        that you knew that you were overwriting all of Charlie's changes
        (because it gave you the new file), and everyone else will also miss out
        on Charlie's changes

      </ol>

     <p><b>Emacs does notify you when this happens</b>: either use
     emacs or a text editor that does this.</p>

    <li> When the deadline gets really close, I like to print out a
    copy of the paper, mark the changes with a pen, and then quickly
    grab all the tokens for a paper to implement those changes.  (If
    rewrites or large text additions are required, I do those in a
    scratch file.)  I can then very quickly implement my changes while
    holding the tokens for a short period of time.  If time is really
    short and there are lots of papers going in for a deadline, I may
    hand you (physically or virtually) the marked up version to
    implement the changes.  This is meant to save time.  If anything
    is unclear, please <b>ask me</b>.

    <li> If you're actively editing a file, you should only
put in the files needed to <b>generate</b> the output.  Do not store
the intermediate or final output (pdf, log, aux, etc.).  This is not
just to save space (every little change, no matter how small, will
force a multi-megabyte file to be saved) but also because it can get
in the way of other people as they're compiling the document.</li>

    <li>I also prefer using pdf (vector) and png (raster) files for graphics
(as appropriate); this is because the output of pdflatex is usually
better/easier than that of latex.  </li>

    <li> Organize the files as follows:
      <ol>
	<li> Keep all style files (e.g. things that could be shared between submissions) in the "style" folder
	<li> Keep all bibliography files (e.g., bibtex source) in the "bib" folder
	<li> Have the main body in a file called
	"YYYY_venue_project.tex" and the associated data (sections,
	graphics, etc.) in a folder called "YYYY_venue_project"
	<li> This allows the Makefile to work well and reduces clutter
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li> What about ShareLaTeX or Overleaf?  They are not mature enough, they
    don't work offline, and I cannot use command line tools (latexdiff, grep,
    etc.), so I'd rather just work with svn or git.</li>
</p>


  </ol>

<h3>Error Analysis</h3>

<p>When writing a paper with an objective measure of success or
failure, it is important to include an error analysis.  This is
helpful for multiple reasons: it shows that you've actually looked at
your data, that you understand what your algorithm is doing, and you
know how your method is better (or at least different) from other
algorithms.</p>

<p>For example, let's say that you're doing a paper on word
segmentation and you're comparing to
the <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/Pubs/pedersen-last-word-2008.pdf">Zigglebottom
segmenter</a>.  One thing you can do is sort all of your sentences by
the following metric: #words you got right - #words Zigglebottom got
right.  You should look at both extremes.  Are there patterns in the
things you get right and they get wrong?  If so, that likely reveals
something about what your algorithm is doing.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you're writing a paper on a well-known task / method,
you risk a reviewer reading it and saying, okay, I might do slightly
better, but why?  Are there pitfalls I should be aware of? It also
makes sure you understand what you're claiming better, which allows
you to write a better paper overall.</p>

<p>Moreover, good error analysis
can <a href="http://socleopard.blogspot.com/2014/09/error-analysis-of-week-ratnaparkhi-on.html">improve
your model</a>.</p>

<h3>Writing an Author Response Document</h3>

<p>For some conferences and most journals, you will have the opportunity to
respond the the reviews you've received.  This often doesn't matter.  Many times
the reviewers all loved or hated your paper.  You don't have much of a chance to
change their minds.  When your paper gets marginally positive reviews, a good
response can really help.</p>

<p>First, be as brief and civil as possible.  If you don't have much
to say, don't try to fill the space.  Only use as much of the allotted
space as you actually need.  If there are no statements of facts you
can offer to help clarify a reviewer's opinion, then just let it go.
Make sure to thank the reviewers and to be gracious.  They may be
idiot numbskulls who trashed your paper, but they did so as a
volunteer.  If they didn't understand something, it's usually your
fault for not writing it well in the first place.</p>

<p>Second, make your response as self-contained as possible.  The PC
will read your response by itself.  They should be able to get the
gist of the reviewer's opinions through your response <b>and</b>
understand your reply without looking anywhere else.  Obviously you
cannot include all necessary details, but make sure your response
stands on its own as a single, coherent document.</p>

  <pre>
    Reviewer Three questions whether the Pope is Catholic.  We follow
    the convention of Capitan Obvious (2003), which has been the
    foundation of many subsequent papers.
  </pre>

<p>Don't get this wrong by writing your response as an inline e-mail.
It's an inefficient use of space and you can better frame the issues
than the reviewers.  (It may be helpful to compose the response next to
the reviews, but don't assume that the reader will have access to that
information.)</p>

<p>Even if you don't get a response, once you get a set of reviews, create a
spreadsheet (shared with co-authors on Google Docs) to address the issues that
the reviewers found with the following columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <i>Reviewer ID</i>: Even if you know who it is (e.g., from a paper
  clinic, it's probably better to turn these into numbers).
  <li> <i>Issue</i>: If it's a typo, note the typo. If it's something bigger,
  like a characterization issue, copy-paste or paraphrase.
  <li> <i>Notes</i>: Write down anything that might be relevant to jog your
  memory if you come back to it later (e.g., related work, a paper that does
  this well, etc.).
  <li> <i>Difficulty</i>: On a scale of 0 (fix a typo) to 10 (rewrite all the
  things!), how hard do you anticipate the fix being? This will become quite
  important in a few moments, so be honest!
  <li> <i>Fix</i>: How can you fix the issue? A very important note here: "I'm
  not going to fix it" is a perfectly legitimate response!
  <li> <i>Who</i>: For multi-author papers, keep have the first author assign
  responsibility to each of the authors.
  <li> <i>Done</i>: Has this been addressed?  For non-trivial stuff, explain how
  the problem was solved.
</ul>

<p>Other than organizational fixes (which should be done first), it's often
easier to go in increasing order of difficulty.  Lots of little fixes can
sometimes fix bigger issues as you work your way through.  This spreadsheet will
also help to write a response document (more important for journals than conferences).</p>


<h3>Checklist before submitting something</h3>

  <ol>
    <li> Look over your citations.  Do they look uniform?  Sometimes when you
    copy/paste a bibtex citation, junk comes with.
    <li> Read over your section titles.  Do they tell a story?  Don't just use
    "introduction", "background", "model", "inference", "conclusion", etc.
    While your sections may map to those, call them something more specific.
    <li> Do your figures stand on their own?  Make sure a bored reader /
    reviewer can get the gist of what's going on through the figures alone.  So if your first figure is about the data you use, make sure that motivates the method you'll use.  If you have a figure of the graphical model, don't just say "our graphical model"; instead, point out the salient aspects of the model that makes it interesting to a reader under time pressure.  If you have a figure of results, don't just say "summary of results"; instead, point out what the results mean in the caption.  You'll say something similar in the text, so don't repeat yourself.  Likely there are different interesting trends you can point out.
    <li> Is your abstract persuasive and interesting?  When an area chair reads it, will they send it to the reviewers that you want?
    <li> Do a spellcheck!
    <li> Make sure you've spelled your co-authors' names correctly (not always
    obvious; perhaps they use middle initials or a different name / spelling for
    publishing) and you have the correct affiliation (did they move since you
    first wrote the paper)?
  </ol>

<h3>Camera Ready</h3>

<p>First, congrats! It's great that your paper has been accepted. Your
work isn't done yet. Do not ignore these steps. They are very
important for you to take ownership of the paper, make sure that your
reputation will be safe, and to keep your advisor and funders
happy.</p>

<ol> <li> Immediately (within one week), do the following: <ol> <li> Have your
advisor give notes on the current draft of the paper <li> Add acknowledgements
to anyone who helped you at any point while working on the paper.  Read an early
draft, provided data, provided help, had interesting discussions with, etc.
<li> Add an appropriate acknowledgement to the grant funding you (use previous
papers as an example).  For my students, find your project on my <a
 href="projects.html">projects</a> page, ask about anything you're unsure of.
<li> Turn the reviews into todo lists and order everything starting with easy /
obvious things and going down the list to impossible / difficult / things you
disagree with (call the items generated from the first two items TODO)

  <li> Make a list of relevant papers that have come out since you submitted
(call this list CITE) </li>

  <li> Move the paper to a public publications repo to make it easier for people
to read drafts and make suggestions.</li>

</ol>

<li> Within two weeks, meet with your advisor to select:
<ol>
<li> What things out of TODO are trivial
<li> See if they have other things to add to the list
<li> What citations to add from your CITE list
</ol>

<li> Within three weeks, create a version of the document that:
<ol>
<li> Addresses all of the trivial issues from the TODO list and CITE
list
<li> Has everything spell-checked and typos corrected
<li> Has everyone's name is added to author list and spelled correctly
(if there's any doubt, ask)
<li> Uses the right style file (it sometimes changes between
submission and camera ready)
<li> Cite any recent work that's relevant and has come out (or you
learned about) since you submitted Has no widows or orphans
</ol>

<li>In the rest of the time left:
<ol>
<li> Send the document to other folks to read over (you must do this
if there are any coauthors not deeply involved in the writing process)
<li> Carefully incorporate their suggestions, but don't ever let the
document leave a camera ready state
<li> Work on any of the more difficult TODOs
</ol>

<li>Once you submit the document:
<ol>
<li> Put it on your webpage and send the final PDFs to the authors
<li> Notify your department's publication mailing list
<li> Update your CV
<li> Post any associated data and code on your webpage
</ol>

</ol>


<h3>Talks</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Read these general advice pieces from <a
  href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9703019v1.pdf">Robert Geroch</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-give-a-talk.html">Jason</a>.
  <li> Use Beamer and OmniGraffle (but keep your Beamer slides
  uncluttered with navigation and sections).
  <li> Don't use a laser pointer (integrate any emphasis into your slides).  People have a tendency to over-use laser pointers, and they are not always usable (because of the screen, multiple screens, etc.).
  <li> Don't read from notes (and don't use your slides as notes).  If you feel uncomfortable delivering the talk, it means you need to practice more.
  <li> If you can ever use a picture instead of an equation, choose the picture (even if it takes more time).
</ol>

<h3>Posters</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Use Beamer
  <li> Use blocks with informative titles (just like section headings)
  <li> Do not put two images / tables in a block unless they are
  showing <b>very</b> related information (e.g., don't put results from two
  different datasets in the same block).
</ol>

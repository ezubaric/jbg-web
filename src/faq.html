<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>FAQ FAQ</h3>

<p class="question">This is really intimidating.  Do you expect all
students to have read this before asking you a question?</p>

<p class="answer">No! I've put this here for a couple of reasons:
  <ul>
  <li> I get a lot of e-mail.  I want to get less e-mail (or at least
  <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/">better
  e-mail</a>), so I'm hoping that if people find the answer here,
  they'll send me less e-mail.
  <li> I get a lot of e-mail.  I want to answer my e-mail
  quickly, <A HREF="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=388">but
  sometimes I don't</A>.  I'm hoping that if people find the
  information they need here, they won't have to wait for me to
  answer.
  <li> Some students are shy about asking questions; if they can find
  an answer here that they were too afraid to ask, then everyone is
  better off.
  <li> I want to make sure I treat students fairly.  If I put
  policies/expectations out here publicly, it gives me less leeway for
  my latent biases to impact students.
</ul>
 </p>

<h3>Prospective Students</h3>

<p class="question"> I want to work with you, and I'm currently a
grad student at the University of Maryland.  How do I do that?</p>

<p class="answer"><B>Specifically for students matriculating 2020: I'm on
sabbatical 2019-2020 and not actively involved in admissions.  I might
work with you, but I'm trying to enjoy my sabbatical in the meantime.
I'll get more involved once admissions are complete!</B></p>

<p class="answer">In general, the matching process at UMD between
professor and student typically happens during the first year (not
before).  This allows the student to get comfortable and set up within
the university, adjust to the region, and to figure out how much time
they have to devote to research.  This is good because this also lets
you get a sense for the research going on and what the personalities
of the various professors/groups are.</p>

<p class="answer">If you want to work specifically with me, then take
computational linguistics or machine learning (because of the huge
number of students who want to work with me, this
is <b>non-negotiable</b>; it will teach you what you need to know and
will provide me a good sense of your abilities).  Once you've done
that, send me an e-mail with a high-level view of what sorts of things
you're interested in and your courseload for when we'd be working
together (I don't want to work with students who have no time for
research).</p>

<p class="answer"> Then <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUc2QWN2OHN6bWxwfGRlZmF1bHR8ZGI4OGMxZGYwZjUwYzc4NTlhN2MzN2EzNmY4OTg5MTE">schedule a
meeting</a>, and we'll figure out a project to work on together to
show that you're able to work independently on a self-contained
project.  After we finish the project, we can discuss longer-term
arrangements.</p>

<p class="question"> I want to work with you, and I'm currently an
undergrad student at the University of Maryland.  How do I do that?</a>

<p class="answer"> First, take either the undergraduate natural language processing
course or the undergraduate machine learning course.  In other words,
you first need to learn how to program and learn some specialized
skills.     But try to take these courses as quickly as you possibly can!</p>

<p class="answer"> <b>Then</b>, send me an e-mail.     I will send you a challenge problem
to complete in about a week.  If you don't have a week to work on a
challenging problem, then wait to e-mail me when you have some time to
work on such a problem (warning: if I'm having a particularly busy
week, I may not get back to you quickly, as putting together a
challenge problem takes some time too).</p>

<p class="answer"> You'll need to sign up to work with me as an independent study.  I'll
also ask you to have a fairly light course load the semester you work
with me, as undergraduate students have a tendency to take on too
much.</p>

<p class="question">I want to work with you, and I'm not currently a
student at Maryland.  How do I work with you?</p>

<p class="answer">Then you should apply to be a student at Maryland.
The best way would be to apply to
 <a href="http://cs.umd.edu/grad/catalog">computer
science</a> and mention me specifically in your application.  After
you submit an application, please drop me an e-mail (put GRADAPP-20XX
in the subject) with your CV letting me know you applied.  I may not
reply, but it's still very useful!</p>

<P>Please also consider applying to
the <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck">MPI-SWS joint
program!</A></P>

<P>I also have students who are now faculty; if you want to work on
the sorts of things that I work on but want an energetic,
knowledgeable advisor instead of
a <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-eKIZQ4_Gw">has been</A>
consider applying to work with
them: <A HREF="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/">Mohit Iyyer</A>
and <A HREF="https://hhexiy.github.io/">He He</A>.</P>

<p class="answer">To help me quickly search for such e-mails (and to show that
  you've done your homework by reading this FAQ), please put GRADAPP-20XX in the
  subject line, where XX is the year you hope to enroll.</p>

<p class="question">How many <a name="students"></a>students do you plan to admit this year?</p>

<p class="answer">See the <a href="openings.html">openings page</a>.

<p class="question">Are PhD students at Maryland funded?</p>

<p class="answer">The University of Maryland, like all top American
universities, makes a commitment to fund PhD students so long as
they're making adequate progress.  This includes supporting tuition, a
stipend, and health insurance.
This is typically through a combination of research assistant positions
and teaching assistant positions (my students typically TA once or
twice).</p>

<p class="question">Can I mention you in my statement of purpose?</p>

<p class="answer">You don't need to specifically ask my permission to
list my name in a statement of purpose so long as our interests are a
good match.  If you think they are, go ahead!  (However, it may not
help you to list me if I'm not taking students in a particular
year.)</p>

<p class="question">Do you have any postdocs available?</p>

<p class="answer">I'm fairly junior, so I'm trying to fund students
right now.  I'm fairly good about keeping my webpage updated, so see
the <a href="openings.html">openings page</a>.</p>

<p class="question"> I want to work with you, and I'm currently a student at
Colorado</p>

<p class="answer">I moved to the University of Maryland in August
2017.  I will no longer be advising new students at the University of
Colorado.</p>

<p class="question">Can I work with you as an intern?</p>

<p class="answer">Unfortunately, it's very hard to evaluate the
quality of candidates without a formal system (e.g., as we have for
university admissions).  As a result, it is my policy only to work
with people directly recommended to me by a professor or
researcher <b>with whom I already have a relationship</b>.</p>

<p class="question">Will I get admitted?  Why was I rejected?</p>

<p class="answer">I will not answer this sort of question. Don't even
bother asking.  I cannot give opinions on whether you will get
accepted without seeing a full application. There are numerous venues
where you can get <a href="http://thegradcafe.com/">uninformed
opinions</a> <a href="http://quora.com">about your chances</a>.  In
any given year, which students I accept depends on funding amounts,
match between project and students, and who says yes or no and
when. It's a very stochastic process, and
<a
 href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-graduate-school-admissions">I
wish we had a more logical system</a>.  </p>

<p class="question">Where should I do my PhD?</p>

<p class="answer">The most important thing
is <A HREF="https://medium.com/@vijayc/how-to-pick-a-grad-school-for-a-phd-in-computer-science-a5ce7dceb246">finding
a PhD program where you will be happy</A>.  Hopefully that will be
UMD; students often put too much weight on rankings.  Don't ignore
rankings, but pay attention to the people involved and your fit with
the group.</p>

<p class="answer">If you absolutely must look at rankings, I
think <a href="CSrankings.org">CSRankings.org</a> are the least bad
rankings available.</p>

<p class="question">Can I do a PhD with you online?</p>

<p class="answer">A PhD is about learning how to be a researcher, and
it's difficult to do that online, in part because much of what you
learn is from your peers, not from a professor.  Unless there's a very
special circumstance (e.g., you're physically working with one of my
existing collaborators), an online PhD is not workable.  Even if it
might work, it puts you at a competitive disadvantage to other
applicants who are willing to physically be present.</p>

<!--
<p class="question">Can I have a fee waiver?</p>

<p class="answer">This is a bit of a misnomer.  Fee waivers do not mean the
fee is waived.  It means that <b>I</b> pay it for a prospective student.  I'm
happy to do so for a very strong student, but cannot do so for many students.
If this is an issue, please write in an e-mail (with GRADAPP-20XX in the
subject) that you <b>request a fee waiver</b>.  If I reply explicitly
saying <b>I will pay your application fee</b>, then you may check the fee waiver
box on your application.  Otherwise, I'm very sorry, but I cannot help that many
applicants with their application fees.</p>

<p>I do provide fee waivers to strong candidates with a disadvantaged
/ non-traditional background.  I (roughly) judge candidate strength
from a CV, but the other criteria require a personal statement that
explains your background.</p>

<p>If it were up to me, I would make grad school admissions free (or
at least based on country/region GDP), but at Colorado it is the
faculty that must pay for fee waivers, so I need to be selective.</p>
-->

<p class="question">You asked me to do a virtual interview after I
applied for a PhD position.  What does that mean and what should I do
to prepare?</p>

<p class="answer">First, it means that you really stood out in the
pool of applicants!  I typically only interview five to ten applicants
a year to select the candidates I will eventually invite to
attend.</p>

<p class="answer">In many ways, it's a sanity check.  If you say in
your application that you're really good at X and you want to do Y,
I'll ask about those things in a little more detail to better
understand your background and your skills.  I'll also ask about what
you want out of a PhD program.</p>

<p class="answer">This really is a two-way conversation, however.
We're going to work with each other for N years, and we both need to
be sure that we can stand each other and work well together.  So it's
important for candidates to ask whatever questions they're concerned
about too.</p>

<h3>Current Students</h3>

<p class="question">Can you give me a letter of reference?</p>

<p class="answer">I typically only write letters for students whose
committee I've served on, whom I've worked on a research project with,
or who did very well in my class.  Unless you are my direct advisee,
you <b>must</b> ask me before giving my name out.</p>

<p class="answer">When you ask, please send a list of bulleted points
that answers the following questions: how we know each other
(e.g. took class X, received grade Y, completed project on Z), what
research we have worked on (what the project was about, where it was
published, your role in the project), what you're applying to, when
you will send me <b>all</b> of the rec requests, and when the deadline
is.  Good rec letters contain details, and the more details you can
provide that I can then surround with context, the better your letter
will be.</p>

<p class="answer">For example, if I relied on my memory to write a
letter of recommendation, I would be able to say something like "Susan
took my class and did great, she did a project on music stuff".
That's not as good as "Susan took my class Fall 2015, earned an A, and
presented a final project on distinguishing musical styles
automatically given the waveform of a song.  Their group used a
variety of techniques (support vector machines, convolutional neural
nets, and k-nearest neighbors) to decrease the error rate of a strong
baseline from 0.4 to 0.2".  Obviously the second one is better, but I
can't recall of the details myself.  Your bullet points will help me
recall details and to put your work into context.</p>

<P CLASS="answer">I do have some rules about writing letters for grad
school, though.  These are non-negotiable given the large volume of
letters I have to send out.
  <OL>
    <LI> I must get all of the requests at once.  I don't want them to
    trickle in; I need to be able to submit all my letters for you in
    once sitting.
    <LI> I must have at least three weeks warning (e.g., if the first
    deadline is December 1, I need to know by November 10 that you
    want me to write a letter).  I cannot write a good letter if I
    don't have time to prepare.
    <LI> I must have at least a one week window to submit your
    letters.  So you need to have sent out <B>ALL</B> recommendation
    requests a week before the deadline.
  </OL>
</P>

<p class="question">What are your expectations / preferences in terms
of what a student should know?</p>

<p class="answer">
I personally like C++ and Python, but the culture here leans to Java,
which I've been using more and more (and likely will continue to).  I
prefer writing tests to debugging, but debugging is a necessary evil.
I do like reinventing the wheel somewhat to keep things self-contained
and consistent, but I contribute the result to things
like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nltk">NLTK</a> so that other
people don't have to do the same.  I also like using style checkers
and the like to keep myself organized.  (Though I say this, you can
get a more honest picture of my coding style by looking at what I've
actually written.)</p>

<p class="answer">Students who want to work with me should</p>
<ol>
  <li> have basic knowledge of Python, C++, <b>or</b> Java (e.g. be
  able to write a dynamic program in that language),
  <li> understand probability (Bayes rule, conditional probabilities,
  smoothing),
  <li> compile LaTeX documents using BibTeX, and
  <li> use version control software (e.g. git or svn)
</ol>
<p class="answer">These are the bare <b>minimum</b> requirements.  If
you do not meet these requirements, please take some classes to
acquire these skills (preferably mine!) before asking to collaborate
on research.</p>

<p class="answer">You should already code in <b>some</b> language
pretty well, and conforming to my coding style will increase the
probability that I'll be more hands-on in helping you code and debug,
but if you want to program in LISP or Prolog, that's perfectly fine
too, as long as it works for you.</p>

<p class="answer">Being comfortable with probability is probably the
more important requirement.  You'll likely have to deal with messy
probability distributions, take expectations, derive conditional
distributions given a joint distribution, implement dynamic programming
to sample from PCFG grammars, do Taylor approximations, do some
optimizations, etc.  This shouldn't be taken as a laundry list of
things you should know (it's great if you do) but just as a heads up
of the kinds of things you might run into; part of a graduate
education (life, for that matter) is learning new stuff.  There will
be many opportunities to learn: from classes, your peers, and reading
group.</p>

<p class="answer">I think attending (and contributing to) a reading
group or two is critical for learning about a field and being a good
scholar; it's fun and not a chore at all, but I want to be up front in
saying that any student of mine should be an <b>active</b> participant
(i.e., don't just show up; you need to present paper and be involved
in the discussion of every paper.  If you didn't understand a paper,
ask smart questions until you do.  If you did understand a paper well,
answer other people's questions.) in a reading group or two.</p>

<p class="answer">Reading groups are also important for being able to
"look smart" when you're interviewing.  You'll need to be able to
connect your work to what other people do.  A reading group lets you
know how your thesis connects to other research topics and talk
intelligently about them.  Unfortunately, this can't be done quickly;
it requires dedication over many years to learn about the breadth of
research that folks explore.  So while you might feel like skipping
reading group once is a good decision to get more work done, it's
ultimately a bad decision because you need to consistently go to
understand a broad range of topics.</p>

<p class="question">How do you interact with students?</p>

<p class="answer">I like to have a group meeting every other week with
students I'm working with (broadly construed), and one-on-one meetings
as needed with students.  I use Google calendar
to <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUc2QWN2OHN6bWxwfGRlZmF1bHR8ZGI4OGMxZGYwZjUwYzc4NTlhN2MzN2EzNmY4OTg5MTE">set
up my appointments</a>, so students can grab a meeting whenever they
need to.  I expect students working with me full time to meet with me
on average once a week (sometimes much more, such as before a paper
deadline, and sometimes less).  I use this online system so that my
meetings are contiguous and that students always know when I'm
available (and I can change things without e-mail).  Students should
sign up for a meeting at least 24 hours in advance.  It's okay to
schedule meetings outside of that time, but that should be the
exception (I try to maximize the amount of contiguous time I have to
research, write, and think).</p>

<p class="answer">In addition, everyone in my group (me included)
sends a weekly e-mail to everybody saying:
<ul>
  <li class="answer"> What they worked on that week </li>
  <li class="answer"> What they plan to work on next week </li>
  <li class="answer"> Anything that's holding them up or blocking their progress </li>
</ul></p>
<p class="answer">Anyone who is working for me full time or who is my
direct advisee <b>must</b> send me such an e-mail (with the subject
[Snippet YYYY MM DD]) sometime Sunday evening or Monday morning.  I
find that this is very helpful because I sometimes ask myself (or have
funding agencies ask me) what I (and my students) did in a particular
time period.  These e-mails really help me figure that out without
bugging other people.  It also helps me stay productive by setting
realistic goals; I use this weekly todo list to populate my daily todo
list.</p>

<p class="answer">So what makes a good goal?  You should have "Big
Picture Goals" that carry over from week to week; these are often at
the level of something you want to make happen this year or semester.
Every week you should do something that brings you closer to achieving
those big goals.  Within a week, your goals should
be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">smart</a>.
Don't have vague goals like "write code" or "continue reading".  It
should be obvious whether you succeeded or not in your goal (specific
and measurable), it should fit in with the big picture (relevant), it
should be doable in a week (time-bound and attainable).</p>

<p class="answer">It's okay to send it earlier than Monday; the
weekend is fine too.  If you're a day late, that's less good, but
better than not sending it at all.  However, keep the Monday date in
the subject so I can search for it.  (Or just reply to the first
Snippet that gets sent; no need to wait for me, it's okay to start the
chain.) </p>

<p class="answer">The snippet should be sent to both the project
you're working on the group e-mail list. </p>

<p class="answer">Outside of that, I prefer face-to-face communication
(when I'm not sitting down at my computer being productive) or e-mail
as a communication mechanism.  Instant messages are also sometimes
okay for quick questions, but never send an e-mail and then ask via IM
"Did you see my e-mail?"</p>

<p class="question">Do I have to be in lab?</p>

<p class="answer">One of the great things about academia is the
ability to have a flexible schedule, working when and where you want.
However, there are limits to this.  On days where we have meetings,
it's best if you come <b>in person</b> to those meetings.  Within
reason, it's okay to join remotely some of the time, but the norm
should be to attend in person.</p>

<p class="answer">Beyond meetings, it's also good to work a <b>full
day</b> at least once a week.  It's important to have a place where
you can work productively in the lab, be a part of the lab community,
and to absorb the lab culture and its tacit knowledge.  Don't just
appear on campus for meetings and then disappear.</p>

<p class="answer">Finally, when we have a big paper deadline, you
absolutely <b>must make every effort</b> to be in lab (if you aren't
lab, I expect a far better explanation than "I didn't feel like it").
I work very hard to make sure I'm able to do this (e.g., flying in
relatives to help with my daughter), and I expect you to do the same.
The most important part of your job is publishing papers, and while
there are good electronic tools to facilitate collaboration, they are
not a replacement for in-person communication.  Particularly for
inexperienced students, being around older students working on papers
is a very valuable experience.  You don't know what you don't know,
and you can get valuable information from being in the same room as
other people working on papers.</p>

<p class="question">I'm working with undergrads / high school
students.  How do I lead a research project?</p>

<p class="answer">First, you need to set the research agenda.  Create
a roadmap that lays out all of the things that need to be done and
pointers and references to help them along.  The sorts of things that
should be included in this roadmap are: references, sketches of
models, pointers to where data / tools live, etc.  This document
should be very complete; try to anticipate the questions that will
come up (i.e., preempt frustration).</p>

<p class="answer">In communications, make sure you keep me (faculty
member) in the loop.  I'm ultimately responsible for what happens, so
I should know what's going on.  Ideally, I'll leave the two of you to
do good research on your own, but I like to see a good project
develop.  I also want to be able to step in if problems are developing.</p>

<p class="answer">It's important that the students are constantly able
to make progress.  If they're waiting on you for something, you're
losing momentum on the project and increasingly the likelihood that
they'll abandon the project (the biggest risk of working with
undergrads).  Make sure the project is structured in small bite-sized
pieces that can be tackled linearly.</p>

<p class="answer">Make sure that the lines of communication are open.
Junior students should be making regular updates (sending snippets,
make sure to explain this concept to students).  If a student
disappears for a while, make sure you follow up and see what's going on.</p>

<p class="answer">Ideally, leading a research project should be a low
bandwidth, low latency interaction.  You need to be prompt and
responsive, but if things are working well, junior researchers will be
doing most of the work.  You need to make sure that they have the
tools and information to make progress.</p>

<p class="question">I need you to do something (look over a draft,
send an e-mail, etc.).  How should I best make sure that happens?</p>

<p class="answer">The most important thing is to make sure it's on my
radar.  If you have an important deadline, make sure it appears in
your snippet that you send me weekly.  I will make sure I budget my
time to ensure that it gets taken care of.  Give me as much warning as
possible.  I get grumpy if I have to rearrange my schedule for you at
the last minute.</p>

<p class="answer">It's fine (and helpful) for you to remind me.
However, I'd like to make the following caveats.  Unless the deadline
is hours away, the best way is over e-mail; not phone or IM.  It's
less intrusive and I have systems for dealing with tasks that arrive
over e-mail.  The frequency of the reminder is also important.  No
more than once every five days, I would suggest.</p>

<p class="answer">Finally, make it as easy as possible for me to do
what you need me to do.  Have your reminder e-mail reference all of
the material I need to do the task.  If I'm reviewing a paper, remind
me where in the repository it lives and send me a compiled PDF.  If I
need to write a letter, provide the background material and the
contact information in one place.</p>

<p class="question">How important are classes once I'm a PhD student?</p>

<p class="answer">One very frequent problem I see is that young first
year PhD students want to do very well in their classes and think of
research as a hobby.</p>

<p class="answer">For RAs, it is very much a job.  Your professor has
secured funding for PhD students to do research and to produce
results.  If you fail to produce, it makes the professor look bad to
his funders, and the professor will not want to pay you to do research
in the future (i.e., like a job, you can get fired).</p>

<p class="answer">Grades are not important whatsoever, so long as
you're not getting kicked out of the program.  You should use classes
to become a better researcher, but if you're chasing after an A when a
B would suffice and your research suffers, that's detrimental to
yourself, your professor, and to science.<p>

<p class="answer">If you're not an RA (on fellowship or TA), then
doing research is often a tryout for an RA.  Unless you're 100% sure
you'll have fellowship funding your entire time as a PhD student, you
should make sure your professor would take you on as an RA in a
heartbeat if needed.</p>

<p class="question">How often should I be publishing?</p>

<p class="answer">You should always have an idea that you're actively
working on for a paper.  Publishing between 1-2 papers a year is a
good average (however, this does not mean that you'll always have a
publication every year).  Under normal circumstances, I expect
students have one publication at least submitted before the end of
their second year, two by their proposal, and three by their defense
(it's of course fine to have more, but don't prioritize quantity over
quality).</p>

<p class="answer">If you haven't submitted a strong paper in two
consecutive years as a first author in a top venue (regardless of
whether it is accepted, which can be unfortunately
unfair/unpredictable), that's a huge problem, and you're unlikely to
get an RA in the future.</p>

<p class="question">I'm submitting a paper we talked about, can I add
you as an author?</p>

<p class="answer">I should not be surprised by a paper.  If I'm going
to be an author, I want to: 1) see a draft with the "big picture" at
least two weeks before the deadline 2) see a nearly complete draft at
least a week before the deadline. (I reserve the right to still say no
to papers even if you follow these rules, e.g., if I'm on
vacation.)</p>

<p class="answer">For students working directly with me in my group,
this is less of an issue, I know what's going on and can judge what's
going on and whether we can submit (a collaborative discussion).  But
for students who come to me to discuss an idea, vanish for two
months, and then suddenly appear and want me to be a coauthor, this
can be pretty annoying.  My likely response is "no", I will not be a
coauthor, and I will not contribute to the paper.  If you wait until
the last minute, the paper likely won't be any good, and I have other
papers with authors who were responsible and played by the rules.</p>

<p class="answer">You can still choose to submit, but <b>do not list
me as an author</b>.</p>

<p class="question">Can I work on projects that don't involve you?</p>

<p class="answer">First, there's a question of funding.  If you're
funded on a fellowship, TA, or self-funded, then you just need to make
sure that I'm happy to continue advising you (i.e., making good
progress to your degree, fulfiling the requirements of the research
group like sending snippets).  It's fine to take a break and explore
your interests, but don't ignore your thesis.</p>

<p class="answer">However, If you're funded on a grant, you need to be
working on work that's consistent with the goals of the grant.
Maintaining these relationships is necessary for me (and future
students) to have funding.  If your only publication in three years
has a majority of authors not working on the grant, that will also
look suspicious.</p>

<p class="answer">This isn't to say that you can never work on a
project that doesn't involve me.  For example, many students need a
week or two to wrap up their internship projects.  This is totally
fine, and it's not reasonable (or appropriate) for me to get involved.
However, if you're still working with your internship advisors six
months afterward and it's interfering with your grant-funded work,
then I either need to be involved or you need to give it up.  At the very
least there needs to be a frank conversation between me and the
internship host (it's not fair for you to have to manage these
conflicting relationships/priorities).</p>

<p class="question">Why is it important to cite related work?  Can't
you just add the citations for me?</p>

<p class="answer">I often ask students to cite papers when we're
working on a draft.  Sometimes a citation will be very trivial to add
(e.g., at the end of a sentence), and students may rightly wonder why
I don't just add it myself.  Am I really that lazy?</p>

<p class="answer">Sometimes I am so rushed that it is indeed partly
time pressure that prevents me from citing something myself.  But
often I say this because I want <b>you to read the paper</b>.  It may
not be a paper you're familiar with.  If I just cite it, then you
don't learn the material in the paper (and since this is a paper
you're writing, you should know about that material).</p>

<p class="answer">Sometimes I'll be deliberately vague ("you should
cite Eisner/Dreyer here").  Again, this could be me being lazy, but
sometimes multiple papers could be relevant, and I'm not sure which is
the best paper that should be cited in this circumstance.  Moreover,
particularly when an author (or group of authors) have written a
number of papers on a topic, you should be aware of the whole
trajectory (and there could be follow on papers I may not know about).</p>

<p class="question">Cool.  So this means I can just ignore your
citations until I get to the related work section (which I'll save for
last)?</p>

<p class="answer"><b>NO!</b>  Knowing about previous work could impact
all aspects of the paper.  You might find out about a dataset,
evaluation, or framing of the problem that could help you write other
sections of the paper.  Science is about standing on the shoulders of
giants: if you don't know what has come before, how can you improve on
it?</p>

<p class="answer">This has become an increasingly vexing issue in the
age of deep learning; students believe that neural networks are magic
and that any technique that doesn't have a hidden layer and a
nonlinearity isn't worth their attention.  I can confidently say that
this is not the case (a least in 2018), and older or non-neural papers
are still worth reading, even if your model is neural.</p>

<p class="question">I did a websearch and found some webpages.  Should
I just cite them?</p>

<p class="answer">Peer-reviewed publications are typically built on
other peer-reviewed publications.  Citing unvetted ArXiV publications
or random webpages is not as authoritative as citing a published book
or article.  So you'll need to look at journals, books, and start
tracing the references backward until you start finding primary
sources.  This could be microfiche of newspaper articles, old journal
publications, or dusty books in a library.</p>

<p class="answer">This sounds like a lot of work, but there are people
whose job it is to help you do this: reference librarians.  Talk to
them, figure out how to do these sorts of bibliographic searches.  The
first time you talk to them you'll learn all sorts of tricks
(including many that don't require to physically go to a library).
Once you learn the tools available to you, you'll be in far better
shape to do a good literature review.</p>

<p class="answer">However, sometimes, the best resource is a webpage.
But this should be your last resort.  If your citations are peppered
with old journal articles, newspaper articles, and you've proved that
you can do your legwork, they'll trust you that a website is the
correct citation for a fact and not just the lazy way out.</p>

<p class="question">I didn't become a computer scientist to spend time
with books.  If I can't find it online without leaving my chair, it's
worthless.  Why should I do this?</p>

<p class="answer">Getting a PhD is about learning how to do research.
Research in computer science is not just hacking code and running
experiments.  To do research correctly, you must enter a conversation
that can span decades or centuries.  It is hubris to imagine that
everything relevant on a subject is contained in ArXiV articles and
that few searches on the Internet reveal everything there is to say
on a topic.</p>

<p class="answer">To do that kind of research, you need to understand,
write about, and cite the relevant related research.  While much is
online, a good quantity of older material is trapped behind paywalls
or on paper (computational linguistics is indeed better than many
other fields in this regard though, but not all of your research will
be strictly within computational linguistics).  This is a consequence
of a complicated combination of copyright law, history, and inertia.
You will look foolish if you claim novelty where someone has done it
before or if you don't understand what other people have written about
the subject.</p>

<p class="answer">Many students come in with the goal of being a
professor.  A professor needs to be facile with many sources of
information and in possession of an understanding of the broad sweep of
a field's intellectual history.  Call me old fashioned, but I don't
know of a way to do this without sometimes setting foot in a library
(that said, if there's a way to do it without setting foot in a
library, let me know, because I'm lazy too).</p>

<p class="question">You asked for a PDF/A version of a document, how do I make that and how do I make sure that my files are compliant to start with?</p>

<p class="answer">If you already have a PDF, you
can <A HREF="https://www.pdftron.com/pdf-tools/pdfa-converter/">convert
it online</A>.</p>

<p class="answer">But make sure your files
are <A HREF="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/">compliant
without conversion</A>.</p>

<h3>Academia and Research</h3>

<p class="question">Is topic modeling dead?  Should we all be doing
deep learning?</p>

<p class="answer">Deep learning should be part of any modern
researcher's toolkit.  However, I do not think that this means that we
should completely abandon topic models.  Topic models are still very
useful for use cases where <i>interpretability</i> is important.
You'll still see many researchers
in <a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-and-digital-humanities-by-david-m-blei/">digital
humanities</a> using topic models, for instance, because they care
about telling a good story and understanding their data.</p>

<p class="answer">As topic models become more of a utility, I think
we'll see less of the "topic model of the week" that we saw 2005-2010.
I think the important questions are how to incorporate topic models
into real-world workflows and measuring whether topic models help
users with those tasks.  At the risk of self-promotion, I think a good
example of that is Forough's paper
on <a href="https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/P16-1110/alto-active-learning-with-topic-overviews-for-speeding-label-induction-and-document-labeling">how
topic models help people annotate data more effectively</a>.</p>

<p class="answer">One place where we will see less activity is topic
modeling is as a <b>feature</b> for downstream model, which was quite
popular for a while.  Here, word embedding have completely taken
over.  They obviously do a better job, but perhaps the
interpretability of topic models was a nice side effect that we're
missing out on.</p>

<p class="answer">For a more complete overview of where I think topic
modeling has been, what's it's been useful for, and where it's going,
Yuening, David and I have a new book
on <a href="http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/INR-030">Applications
of Topic Models</a>.</p>

<p class="question">How should I collect/store data?</p>

<p class="answer">Google <a href="https://matthewlincoln.net/2018/03/26/best-practices-for-using-google-sheets-in-your-data-project.html">spreadsheets
are good</a> in most cases during collection.  But once we're done,
they should be stored in a way that's long-term readable (e.g.,
JSON/CSV) and deposited with a library.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p class="question">You cited me.  Can you write a letter for me for immigration purposes?</p>

<p class="answer">I have done a number of these letters and most are
quite easy and painless.  However, I've had a few bad experiences
writing these letters, and I'd like to save myself some pain and
frustration.</P>

<p class="answer">First, I will only write these letters if I know who you
are.  Just citing a paper (of which there are many authors) is not
enough of a relationship.  It is much more helpful if we've meet
somewhere or if your contribution to the paper is clear (a letter of
introduction from your advisor may be useful).</P>

<p class="answer">Second, you will need to help me out by sending me
material to help me write my letter.  This information must be
accurate and well-written.  I have had people send me information with
obvious errors (confusing me with another letter writer; confusing
dates; or not understanding the difference between models, datasets,
and inferred parameters).  If you send me materials with enough
errors, I will ask you to find another letter writer (sorry!).</P>

<p class="answer">You can get a sense of what I consider to be good
writing from my <A HREF="style.html">style page</A>.  Your material
should obey my stylistic conventions and not have useless words.  I
will obviously edit it myself, but make it as easy as possible for me
to do that first.  I highly recommend that you have a non-lawyer
native English speaker review your material before sending it to me.
If you send me materials that are not well written, I will ask you to
find another letter writer (sorry!).</P>

<p class="answer">Often, these letters will need to be reviewed by a
lawyer.  I do not want to be exchanging marked-up Word or WordPerfect
documents.  I am only willing to work with Google Docs for document
review.  If you and your lawyer are not willing to work with this mode
of collaboration, please ask someone else (sorry!).</P>

<P CLASS="answer">So, even after a conditional yes, I reserve the
right to say no if the material or the collaboration don't meet these
conditions.</P>

<p class="question">You're part of an iSchool?  What's that?</p>

<p class="answer">It's <A
HREF="https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/interactions-09.pdf">fun</A>.
Unlike computer science, which can sometimes ignore humans, iSchools
care about the intersection of information, technology, and society.
It's a good fit for me because I'm interested in computational social
science and human-in-the-loop machine learning.</P>

<p class="question">I'm trying to use your code, but I'm having
trouble.  How should I get help?</p>

<p class="answer">E-mail all of the people who worked on the paper associated
with the code with
<ol>
   <li> a minimal (simple as possible) example that can replicate your problem;
   <li> the inputs that replicate your problem (again, this should be as simple
   as possible; sending multi-megabyte files is usually not minimal);
   <li> exactly what you did (the exact command line used);
   <li> what you expected to see;
   <li> what you got instead (include error messages and any output); and
   <li> what versions of various resources you're using (NLTK, Java, gcc, boost,
   protocol buffers, etc.).
</ol></p>

<p class="answer">This information is necessary for us to help you with your
problem.  The simpler it is to replicate your problem, the faster you will get a
response.  More complicated setup take longer for us to try out and debug.  If
your example is simple enough, we can often see the problem ourselves without
running code.</p>

<p class="answer">Each e-mail should be self-contained.  All the information to
reproduce the bug should be in one place. This helps us quickly reproduce the
bug, and it also ensures that you've not tweaked anything that might prevent us
from isolating the issue.</p>

<p class="question">What are your pronoun preferences?</p>

<p class="answer">For myself, he/him/his and they/them/their are both fine.  I
prefer the latter for academic writing and the former for day-to-day
communication.</p>

<p class="answer">If I use the wrong pronoun for you, please let me
know ASAP.</p>

<p class="question">What's up with your name?  Why is it hyphenated?
  What should I call you?  Why is your UMD username "ying"?</p>

<p class="answer">My parents' last names are Boyd and Graber.  When I
was born they hyphenated (why people whose nicknames were "Toni the
Body" and "Little Grabber" would do so is beyond me; my nickname is
obvious).  As a result, I am deeply, personally, against hyphenating
names.  Don't do it.  It's not a sustainable practice, and it leads to
all sorts of problems.  People think my last name is just "Boyd" or
"Graber", web forms don't think I have a valid name, and there's only
about a forty percent chance someone will get my name right after one
telling.</p>

<p class="answer">Most people call me Jordan, which is just fine by me.  I
also answer to JBG.</p>

<p class="answer">Our family calls itself the "Ying"s (wife's name).
That's why my UMD username is ying (and why "Ying" is listed on
Testudo).  My wife, who got to UMD after me,
is <a href="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~zying/">zying</a>.</p>

<p class="question">I'm a TA or grader for one of your courses; what do I need to know?</p>

<ol>
  <li> First, make sure that we have a meeting before the semester starts.
  <li> Attend at least a class or two to get a feel of what's going on.
  <li> As each assignment is posted, look it over to make sure I haven't done
  anything stupid (e.g., a confusing problem); it will make your life easier.
  <li> Once assignments arrive, create an ontology of all of the mistakes that
  people have made (do this before you start "grading"); this will allow you to
  fairly and consistently deduct points.
  <li> Using that ontology, create a template that you can use to provide
  feedback to students (e.g. by copy/paste or deleting).  This allows you to
  explain each mistake in detail without having to retype the same thing over
  and over again.  It also ensures that you give consistent feedback for each
  mistake people make.
  <li> Post a synopsis of the mistakes that people made and how to correct them.
  <li> Never give a grade without explaining why people got the grade they did.
</ol>

<p class="question">Why did you leave the University of Maryland and
then why did you go back?</p>

<p class="answer">I came to Colorado (where I was born) to be close to
my family (especially my dad, who had some health scares) and to start
of a family of our own. By 2016, all went according to plan: my dad
was doing much better and we had a healthy daughter. However, there
were four big reasons I left Colorado: TA allocation, my wife's
career, tenure, and lab space.<BR/>
<button onclick="unhide('coloradoQuestions')">See/hide more FAQ Entries on Colorado/Maryland move</button></P>

<div id="coloradoQuestions" class="hidden" style="background-color:eca1a6">

<p class="question">Who gets what TAs seems like a really minor thing.
How did that affect whether you stayed at Colorado?</p>

<p class="answer">While other faculty in my research area
  taught twenty person courses or forty person courses with a TA, I
  was assigned a hundred person class without a TA.  <I>(More detail:
  This was in August 2016; in February 2016 I had a meeting where I
  thought we had agreed on a single TA for my 100-person class&mdash;I
  even sent a e-mail Jim Comey-style afterward to confirm this
  agreement, but only in August 2016 was I told that no such agreement
  was reached.)</I></P>

<p class="question">How does your wife's career fit into all of this?</P>

<p class="answer">My wife was laid off while five months
  pregnant; afterward, we hoped that the university could help.  There
  were open positions at the college that were a good fit, but she was
  rejected without an interview (they ended up not hiring any of the
  people they did interview and relisted the job without talking to my
  wife).  I repeatedly asked for an explanation/discussion on the
  subject, but didn't get anywhere.</P>

<p class="question">Were you really concerned about tenure?  You had a
bunch of publications, a CAREER award, the Karen Sp&auml;rk Jones
award, "best of" awards at NAACL, CoNLL, and NIPS.  Why don't you just
shut up about tenure?</P>

<p class="answer">I was worried about tenure.  Not because I
  didn't think I had done okay research-wise (still a <I>little</I>
  worried about this until it was over, to be honest), but because
  Colorado wouldn't let me go up for tenure in the first place (I
  wanted it over with and I was worried Colorado was setting me up to
  fail on teaching to string it out three to four years, which seemed like a possibility given the lack of certainty and promises that didn't pan out). </P>

<p class="answer"> The TA allocation issue (above) wouldn't be so bad
  if it also wasn't tied into whether or not I would get tenure.  I
  misunderstood how tenure worked at Colorado, and the offer letter
  that I signed treated me like a fresh out of PhD assistant professor
  (despite four strong years at Maryland&hellip;other faculty from the
  University of Maryland system with fewer years on the tenure track
  who came to Colorado CS that year did get credit toward tenure).  I
  was told that I wouldn't be able to get tenure until 2021, eleven
  years after I started on the tenure-track.  After some negotiation,
  it seemed that there might be some wiggle room there, but only after
  I taught that low-level undergrad course.</P>

<p class="answer"> However, I was stuck with a
  giant, new (i.e., taught for the very first time by me or anyone
  else) course with no TA (see above).  In addition to being a lot of
  work, this course would determine if I would be able to go up for
  tenure "early" (to Colorado, anyway, the very earliest I could get
  tenure at Colorado was three years after I would have gotten tenure
  at Maryland if I stayed).  At the time, I felt like I would have a
  very difficult time getting tenure at Colorado.</P>

<p class="question">But you announced that
Colorado <A HREF="https://connections.cu.edu/stories/tenure-list-june-2017">gave
you tenure in 2017</A>.  Why wasn't that the end of it?</P>

<p class="answer">The same week I learned that the College of
  Engineering would finally get my tenure case rolling (thanks to an
  offer from UMD), the department moved my lab/office from a space I
  was perfectly happy with to a windowless basement (which I was very
  unhappy with).  There was no discussion or consultation before the
  changes were announced.  Also, my wife was still unhappy with career
  prospects in Colorado.</P>

<p class="answer">I came to the realization I am not the bureaucratic
bare-knuckled brawler required to make it on my own at a place like
Colorado, and I didn't have the kind of support a crappy negotiator
like me would need to survive.  Even after getting an offer from
Maryland, Colorado did not write anything down on paper to resolve
(i.e., no retention offer) the above issues, and while various verbal promises were made, nothing was ever written down.  In the end, it became
clear we would need to <b>find our own solution and leave
Colorado</b>.</P>

<p class="question">Why put this academic dirty laundry on your webpage?</P>

<p class="answer">I don't want people to make the same mistakes I did.
One of my closest friends was contemplating a pre-tenure move and was
about to sign a standard assistant professor contract.  I doubt it
would have turned out as badly as it did for me, but if I can prevent
that from happening to someone else, it's worth it.</P>

<p class="answer">Also, I think there's value in sharing when career plans and tenure don't work out perfectly.  It helps people understand the reality better than social media's sample bias.</p>

<p class="question">How did this make you feel?</P>

<p class="answer">I <A HREF="https://www.quora.com/How-does-it-feel-to-not-get-tenure/answer/Jordan-Boyd-Graber?ch=10&share=1e9b351a&srid=3bYE">answered this question on Quora</A>, which caused a bit of a stir at Colorado.</P>
  
<p class="answer">My response was fairly <A HREF="https://books.google.ch/books/about/On_Grief_and_Grieving.html?id=0TltiT8Y9CYC&redir_esc=y">typical for these sorts of events</A>, since in many ways I was grieving for what seemed to me to be the end of my academic career.  First I was in denial, thinking that everything was okay and that I would get a TA for my class despite warning signs to the contrary; when there was clear evidence of a problem I thought that all of my precautions (follow-up memos, having mentor in room when I met with department chair) would save me.  I also put off actually meeting with the chair because I assumed that things would just work out withoutdifficult conversations.</P>

<p class="answer">Once it was clear that I didn't have a TA and that my tenure plan was derailed, I was angry.  I remember one evening when I was with my sleeping daughter buying more formula at King Soopers.  I had just gotten an e-mail from the chair that said that they didn't believe that I was ever offered a TA (after my attempts to clear up the confusion failed, and things like my after meeting memos were ignored).  Another faculty member saw me and wanted to chat about research.  I was both angry but also too humiliated to share what was happening to me.  I had a barely coherent conversation with them and then hurried back home to sulk and rage alone until my daughter woke up.</p>

<p class="answer">Then I tried bargaining to make sure that tenure would still work out for me.  I asked if, given the circumstances, the actual course evaluations from this specific class could be excluded from the tenure evaluation.  The chair said they passed on the request to the dean but the dean didn't reply, which the chair explained, "I never heard back [...]  That only happens when the question was inappropriate".   This was depressing because I wasn't important enough for the department to make a strong case for me and not important enough for the college to even respond to.</p>
 
<p class="answer">Then I got depressed.  I kept going through the motions of research and teaching, but didn't do a particularly good job of either.  My wife eventually got things moving with her own job search, which helped get me out of my rut.</p>

<p class="answer">After I accepted that I wasn't going to get tenure at Colorado without a fight and more tribulations, I started to hope that I might be able to get tenure elsewhere, which is how I eventually got out of the mess.</p>

<p class="question">Name names.  Who were your enemies and Colorado?</P>

<p class="answer">At times it felt like there was a grand conspiracy
to prevent me from getting tenure (sure, we'll move up your earliest
tenure date, but only if you pass the gauntlet teaching the largest
undergrad course we offer without a TA!  Survived that course?  To the
dungeon/basement with you!).  I don't think that was actually the
case.  Balls were dropped, things got delayed, and people were super
busy.  I still have nightmares about it, and I wonder if I had said
the right magical incantation or been a little more assertive (e.g.,
shouting "written retention offer" at the top of my lungs) I might
have been able to stay close to my extended family and avoid uprooting
immediate family.  I think I did the best I could at the time, though,
and I also believe the people around me were doing the best they could
under the (unusual) circumstances.  It didn't help that there was a
change of leadership in <B>both</B> the department and college.  While
I still hold a grudge against the institution (which stings as a
native Coloradan), I don't blame any of the people (whom I'm not
mentioning by name).</p>

<p class="answer">There is one person I will mention by name, however:
Martha Palmer.  Martha is completely blameless in all of this.  She is
one of the finest, most honorable people I have ever met.  As my
mentor, she did everything in her power to help both me and my wife.
One of the best things to come out of my time in Colorado was to get
to know her better.  Colorado is lucky to have someone like her there.</p>

<p class="question">Why did you go back to Maryland?</P>

<p class="answer">Thankfully, in late 2016, my wife got a great job
offer from UMD and six months later I was very happy to be able to
follow her (there were some stressful months in between, though!).  I
was very excited to be returning to the great research environment
with supportive senior faculty across computer science (tenure home),
UMIACS, language science, and the iSchool (each chipped in for my
position). </p>

<p class="answer"> Outside of working hours, there's a lot I will miss
about Colorado (where I was born and paradise on Earth!), and I am
hoping for lots of opportunities to spend time there and maintain the
professional connections I've made to the great faculty at Colorado.
It's too bad we couldn't advance our careers in Colorado.</p>

<p class="answer">I had described going to Colorado as "returning
home".  However, Maryland made me a postdoc offer when nobody else
would in 2009 (eventually two other fantastic postdoc offers made this
a very difficult decision, but Maryland's was the first in a
particularly brutal hiring season and thus remains psychologically
significant), hired me as faculty when nobody else would in 2010, and
then finally gave me a path to tenure when nobody else would.  While
Colorado is the place where I was born and where I have the most
relatives, Maryland is my academic home, and I'm glad to return.</p>

<p class="question">Why didn't you consider other places?</P>

<p class="answer">When I moved to Colorado, I only applied to schools
in Colorado.  When I left Colorado, I only got an offer from Maryland.
I didn't apply to too many places because I had students on the market
and didn't want to compete with them (thankfully they all got tenure
track jobs!), but I got turned down from three schools in Illinois
(where my wife's family is), two West Coast schools, two East Coast
schools, and one school in Europe.</P>

<P class="answer">In hindsight, I was probably too vague in my cover
letters, and I deferred discussing my tenure trauma to personal
e-mails to specific faculty I knew.  Several of those faculty were on
sabbatical or were (unbeknownst to me) changing affiliation
themselves, so the schools didn't know how motivated I was.</P>

<p class="question">Apart from researchers, was there nothing you
liked about Colorado the institution?  Would you ever consider going back?</P>

<p class="answer">There was a lot that I did like.  I liked using
Concur for reimbursements (this seems minor, but reimbursements are a
major source of stress for me, and I hate Maryland's system<b>s</b>
with a vengance), and the centralized grant administration did seem
like a good way to handle things.  I loved that RTD worked well with
campus and that I could get all public transportation for free.</P>

<p class="answer">With the right leadership (at the department, <A HREF="http://denverpost.com/2019/09/30/cu-boulder-bobby-braun-nasa/">college</A>, and <A HREF="https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2019/12/31/university-colorado-regent-president-applicants-list/">university</A> level), fair TA allocations,
livable grad student stipends, and better lab space, I would consider
going back.  However, having
been <A HREF="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20/20-h/20-h.htm#link2HCH0001">cast
out of paradise</A>, I don't think I will be able to return.</p>

<!--
 I did not get any credit toward tenure at Colorado (after
being a professor for four years at Maryland), and I felt the tenure
process afterward was needlessly unpredictable and difficult.</p>

<p class="answer">I did not receive accurate information about tenure
procedures at Colorado, and the department made my path to tenure more
difficult than it should have been.  I don't want to share too much on
a public webpage (and perhaps I already am), but let me give one
concrete example that will hopefully be helpful to junior/future
tenure-track faculty who might read this and learn from my mistakes.</p>

<p class="answer">I had agreed to teach a new data science course in
Fall 2016 that the department desperately wanted taught.  I agreed to
teach a hundred-student section, as I thought that I would have my
tenure packet submitted at that point and wanted to be a good citizen.
I was then surprised to learn instead this class would instead decide
<i>whether or not I would get tenure in <b>2019</b></i> (nine years
after I started a tenure track position in Maryland); if I didn't do
well teaching this class, my tenure would be delayed even further.</p>

<p class="answer">I didn't want my tenure to be decided by my first
offering of a huge, new class.  On Feburary 1, 2016, I asked for
either a smaller pilot offering of the class or a TA (other faculty in
my area taught 20 person undergrad courses or 48 person undergrad
classes with a TA).  The course remained at 100 students without a TA.
The department leadership changed, and I asked again for help in an
August 4, 2016 meeting.  The course remained at 100 students without a
TA, the largest course without at TA taught by tenured/tenure-track
faculty.  Needless to say, the course did not go well, and in Fall
2016 I had no idea when or whether I would get tenure at Colorado.</p>

<p class="answer">In parallel, my wife was having trouble finding a
science communications job in the small Boulder market.  There was an
open position at my college, but my wife was rejected without an
interview.  The position was left unfilled, however, because the three
people they hired didn't have enough of a science background (my wife
has science degrees from Caltech and Princeton).  I was told after
that my wife would be hired, but then the college relisted the job
instead without anyone with hiring authority talking to my wife.
Every month for six months I asked to discuss what happened, but
nobody from the administration would meet with me about the issue.</p>

<p class="answer">I believe the problem was institutional, not
personal.  The individuals involved mostly made reasonable decisions
given the unusual circumstances, and I don't think there was any
personal animosity toward me.  I think that they are intelligent,
friendly, caring people who want junior faculty to succeed, but did
not have the bandwidth to understand my situation, let alone help.
University administrators are overwhelmed by too many
responsibilities, and a single assistant professor in computer science
who spent four years elsewhere is not worth upsetting campus
procedures or departmental power dynamics.  There were many little
mistakes that were made along the way.  Each individual mistake is
forgivable (and I've forgiven the <i>people</i> involved even if I
still feel betrayed by the <i>institution</i>, which stings as a
native Coloradan), and the mistakes were so broadly distributed that
everyone could say "this is somebody else's problem, and I'm not going
to get worked up about it and try to fix it".</p>

<p class="answer">However, these mistakes did happen and were left
uncorrected.  Together, they created a miserable situation for me and
my family.  I should have fought harder to prevent those mistakes from
being made and to complained more loudly after they were.
Nevertheless, I was either not persistent, persuasive, or sympathetic
enough to get things fixed on my own.  I am not the bureaucratic
bare-knuckled brawler required to make it on my own at a place like
Colorado, and I didn't have the kind of support from senior faculty a
crappy negotiator like me would need to survive.  In the end, it
became clear that if I was going to get tenure and my wife would find
fulfiling employment, we would need to <b>find our own solution and leave
Colorado</b>.</p>

<p class="question">You're going on sabbatical 2019&ndash;2020; are
you going to come back?</p>

<p class="answer">That's the plan. I realize there's a trend of
academics going off to industry and never returning.  My sabbatical
plan was to go to a university (not industry), but UMD wouldn't
approve an academic sabbatical at a German university promptly (I had
to wait over two years for an answer), and then I was left with more
nimble industry options.  And while Z&uuml;rich is also beautiful city
(it reminds me of Colorado), it's not a place I want to stay forever,
and there are research topics I simply cannot explore at Google (or at
least to publish about) that I would really miss.  The plan is
definitely to return to the US and academia.</P>

<!---
<P class="answer">However, <A HREF="http://www.ireneying.net/portfolio/">my
wife</A> had to give up her science communications position at
Maryland; if UMD had let her go on leave as well that would make the
decision to return much easier.  If you know of a good fit for her in
the DC area (or Z&uuml;rich), let us know!</P>

<p class="question">I'm a recruiter for Amabooksoft Finance.  When can
we schedule a call?</p>

<p class="answer">Having tried out corporate research during my
sabbatical, I can safely say that it's not for me (at least full
time).  The only thing that could possibly tempt me is a lab in
Colorado with good funding, the ability to teach/collaborate with a
nearby university, excuses to visit German-speaking Europe, and
freedom to publish.  So unless Siemens, Max Plank, or Swisscom wants
to open up an NLP research lab in Boulder / Ft. Collins / Denver, the
answer is probably no.</p>

<p class="answer">I'm interested in more creative ways of connecting
up, though.  Sponsor
my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ezubaric/featured">Youtube
channel</a> (where thousands of people learn about machine learning
and NLP), sponsor a <a href="http://qanta.org">competition</a> that we
run for high school and college students, or let us take some old GPUs
off your hands.</p>

<p class="question">We have a tenure-track opening at Oxbridge State,
would you be interested?</p>

<p class="answer">Only if there's a simultaneous two body hire and
a good academic research environment (particularly with strong PhD
students) that can compete with the University of Maryland.</p>

<P CLASS="question">I have an innovative solution to cloud computing /
class management / office chairs.  When can we chat about how you can
start as a customer?</P>

<P CLASS="answer">I'm almost certainly the wrong person to talk to.
In many cases, the University of Maryland has strict rules about
procurement that prevent me from actually starting a contract with
anybody.  Moreover, I prefer development on open platforms that
prevent lock-in with a single vendor.  Most of the innovation that's
relevant to our research comes from within the community; if your
company isn't part of that ecosystem already, it's unlikely to be a
good fit.</P>

<P CLASS="answer">Moreover, we academics are pretty poor.  We need to
scrounge for cloud compute credits and our projects are often fairly
bursty in development and usage.</P>

<p class="question">What's your Erd&#246;s-Bacon number?</p>

<p class="answer">While at Princeton, I was also involved with the aphasia
project with Maria Klawe (as a result, I have
an <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/enp/">Erd&#246;s number</a>
of <a href="https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos2.html">2</a>).</p>

<p>My Bacon number is 3 if TV appearances are permissible
links: <A HREF="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=6112">I
appared on Jeopardy! with Alex Trebek</A>, who had a cameo in Short
Cuts (1993) with Fred Ward, who was in Tremors (1990) with Kevin
Bacon.  Thus, my Erd&#246;s-Bacon number is 5, higher than Feynman and
Carl Sagan, tied with Bernard Chazelle, and lower than Natalie Portman
and Noam Chomsky.</p>

<p class="question">Sprichst du Deutsch?  Darf ich mit dir auf Deutsch
reden / e-mailen?</p>

<p class="answer">Zuhause sprechen wir Deutsch, und meine Familie
stammt aus Deutschspr&auml;chigen Gebiete.  Mein Deutsch ist nicht
perfekt, aber ich &uuml;be gern.  Wenn ich wenig Zeit habe, werde ich
viellecht Deutsche e-mails auf Englisch antworten (sonst antworte ich
nie!), aber bitte schreiben Sie weiter auf Deutsch!</p>

<p class="question">You seem to understand Chinese.  Can I talk to you
in Chinese and send you e-mail?</p>

<p class="answer">I'm okay in understanding spoken Chinese, and I can
understand basic things if spoken slowly (I cannot understand
scientific topics).  However, if you talk to me in Chinese and I think
you can understand English, I will likely reply in English because
I've very uncertain of my Chinese.  However, please do <b>not</b> send
me Hanzi e-mails (particularly PDFs, which I can't easily put through
Google Translate); I'm nearly completely illiterate.</p>

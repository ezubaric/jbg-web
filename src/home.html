      <p> I am an Assistant Professor at
  the <a href="http://ischool.umd.edu/">University of Maryland iSchool</a>
  and <a href="http://umiacs.umd.edu">University of Maryland Institute for
  Advanced Computer Studies</a>.  I am affiliated
  with <a href="http://cs.umd.edu">Computer Science</a>,
  the <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/labs/CLIP/">Computational Linguistics
  and Information Processing</a> lab,
  and <a href="http://language.umd.edu">Language Science</a>.  Previously, I was
  a graduate student at Princeton
  with <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei">David Blei</a>.</p>

<p> My research focuses on discovering hidden structure in natural language to
      create new applications.  These applications help users sift through
      decades of documents, discover when individuals control the topic of a
      conversation, or to compete against humans in games that are based in
      natural language.  Because data are cheap, I focus on techniques that are
      <i>unsupervised</i> or only lightly supervised, requiring little
      annotation or human intervention.</p>

  <li> Kim won the Doctoral Research Day best poster award for her work on expressions of grief on Twitter, which will also be presented at ICWSM.</li>
  <li> My students had four papers accepted to ACL 2014 on: dialog modeling (Ke),
  topic modeling domain adaptation for machine translation (Yuening and Ke),
  regularizing spectral algorithms (Thang and Yuening), and detecting ideology
  using deep learning (Mohit).</li>
  <li> I have two students on the job
  market: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ynhu/">Yuening Hu</a> (looking for tenure
  track or postdoc) and <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~zhaike/">Ke Zhai</a>

my <A HREF="faq.html">FAQ</a> page, which covers how to apply and what
sorts of students I'm interested in.</p>

<h3>Postdocs</h3>

<p>If you're a US citizen, I'd like to at some point host a student under <A
    HREF="https://orise.orau.gov/icpostdoc/current-opportunities.html">this
    program</a>.  Get in touch to submit a proposal together! </p>

<p>Please also check out postdoc openings for <A HREF="https://www.trails.umd.edu/getinvolved">TRAILS</A>.</p>
  
<h3>Graduate Students</h3>


<p>Consider applying to the
joint <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck">MPI-UMD program</a>
(Vor allem, wenn Sie einen Bachelor-Abschluss aus Deutschland oder Europa
haben).

  <p>I am looking to admit at least one graduate student for Fall 2025.  The ideal candidate
  is someone who is very technically involved in the workings of modern NLP
  methods and is interested in applying them to human-centered tasks like
  human--computer cooperation for question answering or measuring
  interpretability.</p>

<h3>Summer 2021 Unpaid Internship</h3>

<p>I'm trying something new this year!</p>

<p>First, I want to make it clear that this will be unpaid and remote
(although if you happen to be in Maryland and covid gets under
control, then perhaps we could meet up, but that would not be the
expectation).</p>

<p>This is an experiment for me.  I've never done this before!  So please
forgive the hiccups and growing pains.  Hopefully it will be useful
and fun for all involved.</p>

<p>Here's my current thinking about the process:</p>
<ol>
<li> Take a look at the projects that I've listed here.  The tryout
project is one of the "first step" for each of the ideas.  If you're
able to work independently enough to make good progress on one of
these projects, then you have sufficient background to work on these
sorts of projects.  Note that not all of these are AI/ML per se!  Some
  are creating interfaces, hooking up to other code:
  <ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/Pinafore/cl1-hw/blob/master/project/qa.md">https://github.com/Pinafore/cl1-hw/blob/master/project/qa.md</a>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/Pinafore/cl1-hw/blob/master/project/tryout.md">https://github.com/Pinafore/cl1-hw/blob/master/project/tryout.md</a>
  </ul>

<li> You'll have a look at projects

<li> Watch the video of the <a href="https://umd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d1cd6df4-15b1-4ff3-8dfe-acf7017ae518">QA session</a> that already happened


<li> You'll work on tryout projects before May 1

<li> If folks are able to do the tryout projects successfully (and still
want to do the summer remote internship), we'll form groups of those
who are left.  IMPORTANT: You must do a try-out project to do an
internship.

<li> Then we'll have weekly meetings over the summer and hopefully do
something fun
</ol>

<p>Note that you won't have to work on the same project you use as your
tryout project (e.g., you might find project X more interesting, but
the tryout for project Y fits your skills better), and we might need
to move people around to make the teams make sense.</p>

<p>If you're interested in hearing more about the internship / tryout
process, please sign up for <a href="https://piazza.com/umd/summer2021/cmsc499">Piazza</a> (but you'll need to e-mail me for an access code).</p>



<h3>High School Students</h3>

<p>I'm only interested in working with high school students in the DC
area.  They must: already know how to program in Python, have an
existing, demonstrated interest in the areas that I work in, and be
extremely motivated.  I limit myself to the DC area because there is
an advantage to being able to meet in person; particularly for high
school students, it's difficult to read nuance over the web.
Moreover, it's possible for me to be familiar with local schools and
their programs.  There are simply too many high school students the
world over for me to work with closely.</p>

<p>Once a student contacts me, I will assign a relatively trivial
programming task to them that requires them to understand and modify
an existing piece of code.  This is a necessary prerequisite to
working with me and has a one-week time limit.  (Thus, do not contact
me if you are not going to have any free time over the next few
weeks.)</p>

<p>I know this seems like a lot of hassle, but I want to make sure
that the students I work with are ready to get to work immediately.
Funding is possible, but only after a one-month trial period.</p>

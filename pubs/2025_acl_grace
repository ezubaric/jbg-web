~~ Public | As AI use becomes more common, it's important to measure not just whether the systems are correct but whether they know when they're incorrect.  We propose a new metric to measure this mismatch between correctness and confidence, compare computer ability with human ability, and show that computers have a long way to go before they're well-calibrated.

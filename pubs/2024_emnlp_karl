~~ Public | Flashcard help students study by figuring out which flashcards to show students and when. However, current systems do not pay attention to what information (the actual text of the flashcards) to make these predictions. This paper introduces KARL, a new flashcard scheduler that uses language models to encode the text of flashcards. We host KARL in our own flashcard app for 500+ learners and show that students using KARL learn more efficiently than when they use other traditional systems that only know, for example, that a student has studied Flashcard \#24601 on Monday and got it wrong.

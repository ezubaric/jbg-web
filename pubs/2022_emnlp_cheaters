~~ Public | When the Covid pandemic it, trivia games moved online.  With it came cheating: people tried to quickly Google answers.  This is bad for sportsmanship, but a good source of training data for helping teach computers how to find answers.  We built an interface to harvest this training data from trivia players, fed these into retrieval-based QA systems, showing that these queries were better than the automatically generated queries used by the current state of the art.

~~ Public | Topic models are a tool that historians and social sciences use to explore large text corpora.  But how do you know if you have a good topic model?  Before this paper, the consensus was to use held-out likelihood to evaluate if you had a good model.  This paper argues that this does not fit how people actually use topic models and proposes new human-centered metrics for evaluating topic models.  This method inspired a rethinking of model evaluation and showed that the complexity of a model does not always correspond to what a user might want.

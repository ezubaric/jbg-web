~~ Public | Topic models are tools to help people navigate large document collections.  However, testing whether a topic model is good or not is notoriously hard, as it's subjective and requires asking real people about whether the outputs make sense.  We show that you can ask a language model to recreate the answers of humans, correlating better with ground truth than previous evaluations.

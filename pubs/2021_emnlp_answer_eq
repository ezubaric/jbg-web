~~ Public | Is Tim Cook the same person as Timothy Donald Cook?  You might think so, but the way we train computers to answer questions would say they aren't.  We show that keeping track of multiple names (and it's really simple) can create better question answering systems.  Simply by adding alternate answers mined from knowledge bases, we can improve accuracy 1-2 points on major QA datasets.

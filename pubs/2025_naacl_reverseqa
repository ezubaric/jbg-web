~~ Public | Language models like ChatGPT are pretty good at answering questions (e.g. "What is 12 * 12?"), but we show they can surprisingly struggle when asked to do the reverse task: generating questions for answers (e.g. "Give me a question with the answer 144"). We study when these errors happen, what might be causing them, and how they can be addressed.

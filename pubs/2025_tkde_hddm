~~ Public | Topic modeling is a commonly used text analysis tool for discovering latent topics in a text corpus. However, while topics in a text corpus often exhibit a hierarchical structure (e.g., cellphone is a sub-topic of electronics), most topic modeling methods assume a flat topic structure that ignores the hierarchical dependency among topics, or utilize a predefined topic hierarchy. In this work, we present a novel Hierarchical Deep Document Model (HDDM) to learn topic hierarchies using a variational autoencoder framework. We conduct experiments on four real-world text datasets to evaluate the topic modeling capability of the proposed HDDM method compared to state-of-the-art hierarchical topic modeling benchmarks. HDDM achieves considerable improvement over benchmarks and is capable of learning meaningful topics and topic hierarchies. We also apply HDDM to a real-world medical notes dataset for clinical prediction and show that HDDM can better summarize topics in medical notes, resulting in more accurate clinical predictions.
